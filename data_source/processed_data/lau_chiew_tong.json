The intra predicted residual block is associated with an intra prediction coding mode. The method includes generating a set of residual error blocks including residual data with different statistical characteristics from the residual data in the intra predicted residual block. Each of the residual error blocks is scanned and entropy coded to produce a first set of bit streams. The lengths of each of the first set of bit streams are recorded. The intra predicted residual block is also scanned and entropy coded to produce a second bit stream. The length of the second bit stream is recorded. Selecting the minimum length bit stream from the first set of bit streams and the second bit stream as the output coded bit stream of the intra predicted residual block."}], "keywords": ["Info-Communication Technology", "Internet & Communications", "Computer Networks and Communications"], "citation_table": {}, "citation_graph": {}, "co_authors_url": [], "education": {"Bachelor Degree": "Lakehead University", "Master Degree": "University of British Columbia", "PhD": "University of British Columbia"}, "interests": [], "co_author_network": {}, "pub_graph": {}, "h_index_graph": {}, "i10_index_graph": {}, "avg_citation_graph": {}, "avg_pub_graph": {}}
