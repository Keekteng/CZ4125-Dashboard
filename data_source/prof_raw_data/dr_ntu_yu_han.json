The apparatus autonomously tracks situational information comprising the existing level of work of the e-business, for each of multiple products and/or services offered by the business, and also a desired level of work. In this way, the recommendation protects both the reputation of the business and achieves work-life balance for the business owner."}], "urls": {"dr_ntu": "https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00334", "orcid": null, "personal": "http://hanyu.sg", "han_yu_(google_scholar)": "https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=eXgoTXMAAAAJ&hl=en", "web_of_science": "https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/1174765", "han_yu_(scopus)": "https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55753004000"}}
