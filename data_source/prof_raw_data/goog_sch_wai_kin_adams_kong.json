Since 1993, on the top of IrisCode, different coding methods have been proposed for iris and fingerprint identification. In this research, I extend and generalize IrisCode for real-time secure palmprint identification.

Two versions of TAIG that compute their integrated gradients on a straight-line path and a random piecewise linear path are studied.

To extract the relevant content from each round of an episode, the speakers\u2019 utterances (in the form of video clips) were identified by their timestamps. The clips were selected based on specific criteria, such as containing little noise and being of sufficient length to convey meaningful information. Multiple clips could be extracted from each round, all with the same veracity label. Python scripts were used to automate the download of the clips from YouTube, using the timestamps as reference. This process is described in more detail in Section 3.1 of the main paper."}, {"title": "Supplementary Material of Pure Transformer with Integrated Experts for Scene Text Recognition", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=2GfXvbUAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=2GfXvbUAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "authors": ["Yew Lee Tan", "Adams Wai-Kin Kong", "Jung-Jae Kim"], "description": "Method Year Avg. accuracy Parameters Time 7672 7406 7248(mil.)(ms) Wang et al.[4] AAAI \u201820 86.9-- 18.4 22 Lu et al.[2] PR \u201821 89.3-- 54.6 53 Fang et al.[1] CVPR \u201821-92.8- 36.7 27 Yan et al.[5] CVPR \u201821--91.5 29.1 29 PTIE\u20134 layers 91.6 92.8 92.9 31.2 36 PTIE\u20135 layers 91.9 93.2 93.2 38.6 45 PTIE\u20136 layers 92.4 94.1 93.5 45.9 52"}]}
