In this paper, we comprehensively review the recent progresses of SF6 emission reduction approaches. Currently, the use and emission of SF6 are still on the rise, and mainly concentrated in the power industry. Restrictive use and emission reduction policies are fundamental step in guiding SF6 emission, but they are poor promoted in developing economies. More specific policies and regulations are needed in conjunction with timely and accurate assessments of SF6 atmospheric properties and emissions. SF6 recovery is the direct emission reduction approach, but defects in recovery methods and equipment limit its applications. The development of SF6 purification technologies and optimizations in recovery devices and processes are needed \u2026"}, {"title": "Advances in nanogenerators for electrical power system state sensing and monitoring", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=pDXj9f8AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=pDXj9f8AAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "authors": ["Haocheng Deng", "Song Xiao", "Aijun Yang", "Haoying Wu", "Ju Tang", "Xiaoxing Zhang", "Yi Li"], "publication_date": "2023/7/25", "description": "State perception of electrical power transmission and distribution equipment is an essential support for power grid stability, digitalization and intelligence.
