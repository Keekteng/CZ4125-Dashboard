The purpose of the study was to determine the longitudinal changes of tear evaporation after lid warming in patients with MGD.\nMethods: Ninety patients with MGD were enrolled from a dry eye clinic at Singapore National Eye Center in an interventional trial. Participants were treated with hot towel (n= 22), EyeGiene (n= 22), or Blephasteam (n= 22) twice daily or a single 12-minute session of Lipiflow (n= 24). Ocular surface infrared thermography was performed at baseline and 4 and 12 weeks after the treatment, and image features were extracted from the captured images.\nResults: The baseline of conjunctival tear evaporation (TE) rate (n= 90) was 66.1\u00b121.1 W/min. The rates were not significantly different between sexes, ages, symptom severities, tear breakup times, Schirmer test, corneal fluorescein staining, or treatment groups. Using a general linear model (repeat measures), the conjunctival TE rate was reduced with time after treatment. A higher baseline evaporation rate (\u2265 66 W/min) was associated with greater reduction of evaporation rate after treatment. Seven of 10 thermography features at baseline were predictive of reduction in irritative symptoms after treatment.\nConclusions: Conjunctival TE rates can be effectively reduced by lid warming treatment in some MGD patients.

Accurate localization and categorization of ICH-type is crucial. There are two main categories of ICH: 1) hemorrhagic stroke (HS), which occurs in the deeper or subcortical regions of the brain, where the arterial network tapers to fine end-arteries, and, 2) cerebral amyloid angiopathy hemorrhage (CAAH), which occurs at the superficial or cortical-subcortical region of the grey and white matter junction. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most used imaging tools in diagnosing ICH. However, availability, time, and cost often prevent emergent MRI use. Therefore, CT remains the primary tool in the diagnosis of ICH. The assessment of imaging studies is time-dependent, and a radiologist should do a detailed diagnostic evaluation.

Yet, consensus does not exist on the best energy levels for optimal outcomes when used in patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF)/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT). Methods: This prospective, randomized, controlled trial of 235 adult cardiac arrest patients with VF/VT was conducted in the emergency and cardiology departments.

If return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was not achieved by the third shock, LE patients crossed over to the HE arm and HE patients continued at 360 J. Primary end point was ROSC. Secondary end points were 24-hour, 7-day, and 30-day survival. Results: Both groups were comparable for age, sex, cardiac risk factors, and duration of collapse and VF/VT. Of the 118 patients randomized to the LE group, 48 crossed over to the HE protocol, 24 for persistent VF, and 24 for recurrent VF. First-shock termination rates for HE and LE patients were 66.67% and 64.41%, respectively (P= 0.78, confidence interval: 0.65\u20131.89).

Ultrasound (US) is a widely used imaging modality to diagnose diseases, as it captures moving images and image features correlate well with results from other imaging methods. Furthermore, US does not use ionizing radiation and it is economical when compared to other imaging modalities. However, viewing US images takes time and the relationship between image and tissue composition is complex. Therefore, the diagnostic accuracy depends on both time taken to read the images and experience of the screening practitioner. Computer support tools can reduce the inter-operator variability with lower subject specific expertise, when appropriate processing methods are used. In the current review, we analysed automatic detection methods for the diagnosis of CAD, MI and carotid atherosclerosis based on thoracic and Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS). We found that IVUS is more often used then thoracic US for CAD. The relationship is reversed for MI and for carotid atherosclerosis IVUS is still experimental.

Early detection and quantitative assessment of MI will help to prevent further damage of the cardiac muscles. Though two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram helps to detect MI at early stage, the reading of ultrasound images is subjective due to inter-observer variability and may lead to inconclusive findings which may increase the patient anxiety and cost of treatment. Automated detection of MI and quantification of the extent of MI will enhance the capabilities of diagnosis system. However, little work has been done in the area of computer-based texture analysis for automated detection of extent of MI in general, and existing literature is found to be largely confined only to MI detection. In this thesis, various algorithms have been proposed to identify infarcted myocardium and extent of infarcted myocardium that are categorised into (a) normal myocardium, (b) moderately infarcted myocardium, and (c) severely infarcted myocardium using 2D echocardiogram texture analysis. The automated identification of normal and infarcted myocardium algorithm is developed first, using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), second order statistics calculated from Gray- Level Co-ccurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Higher-Order Spectra (HOS) texture descriptors. The proposed system is validated using 400 MI and 400 normal ultrasound images, obtained from 80 patients with MI and 80 normal subjects.
