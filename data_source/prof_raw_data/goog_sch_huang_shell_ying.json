In the past few decades, much research has been devoted to the technology of AGV systems and rapid progress has been witnessed.

However, most of the existing results are applicable to systems with a small number of AGVs, offering a low degree of concurrency. With a drastically increased number of AGVs in recent applications (e.g. in the order of a hundred in a container handling system), efficient algorithms are needed to resolve the increased contention of resources (e.g. path, loading and unloading buffers) among AGVs.

We propose to enrich the BDI agent architecture with 2 processing components, a PCF (Priority Changing Function) Selector and a Priority Controller. These enable a BDI agent to assign an initial priority value to an intention and change it with time according to the chosen PCF. The initial priority value reflects its urgency at the time of intention creation. The PCF selected defines how the priority should change with time. As an example, we design a function by simulating human behaviors when dealing with several things at the same time. The priority first increases with time according to the Gaussian function to simulate that people are more inclined to do something which has been on their mind for sometime. After a certain time, if the intention still does not get executed because of other higher priority intentions, its priority will decrease according to the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.

This work is to implement the mapping heuristic algorithm for a system with mesh interconnection topology. During implementation, some modifications were made to the original algorithm. The aim was to get a shorter schedule, to minimize contention delay and to minimize the number of processors used for execution without lengthening execution time. Some problems with the updating of the routing tables in the algorithm were identified and solutions were offered to solve them. Experiment results showed that the modified algorithm outperformed the original MH. The modified algorithm also works for systems with other topologies.", "total_citations": 5, "citation_graph": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1}}, {"title": "Twincrane-atcrss-game: Job dispatching with lookahead for twin yard cranes", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=zWYCmiAAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=zWYCmiAAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "authors": ["Shell Ying Huang", "Ya Li", "Xiaoxuan Fan"], "publication_date": "2015", "journal": "The 5th international conference on logistics and maritime systems", "description": "When the handling capacity of one yard crane is not enough for one yard block, two cranes are often deployed.

In these languages, unification in conventional logic programming is replaced by constraint satisfaction. Numerical constraints are usually focused on.
