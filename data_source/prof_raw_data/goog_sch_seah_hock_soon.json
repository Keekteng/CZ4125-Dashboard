Though 3D object detection can provide an object-level environmental description to fill this gap, a robot always encounters incomplete object observation, recurring detections of the same object, error in detection, or intersection between objects when conducting detection continuously in a cluttered room. To solve these problems, we propose a two-stage 3D object detection algorithm which is to fuse multiple views of 3D object point clouds in the first stage and to eliminate unreasonable and intersection detections in the second stage. For each view, the robot performs a 2D object semantic segmentation and obtains 3D object point clouds. Then, an unsupervised segmentation method called Locally Convex Connected Patches (LCCP) is utilized to segment the object accurately from the background. Subsequently, the Manhattan Frame estimation is implemented to calculate the main orientation of the object and subsequently, the 3D object bounding box can be obtained. To deal with the detected objects in multiple views, we construct an object database and propose an object fusion criterion to maintain it automatically. Thus, the same object observed in multi-view is fused together and a more accurate bounding box can be calculated.

The aim of the research study was to enhance students' learning experience and improve their understanding in the threshold concepts of product design, manufacturing and assembly. As a measure to promote active learning, an educational game was introduced in the problem-solving phase of PF. A 3D puzzle game titled \u201cManufactory\u201d was designed, developed and implemented to assist students in improving their 3D spatial abilities. In order to test the presented framework, an experiment was conducted where students were allocated to either a Productive Failure (PF) or Direct Learning (DL) group. For the PF group, students were first required to solve problems in the puzzle game independently during the problemsolving phase, before instructions were given in the second delayed instruction phase.

In response, we propose a two-step acceleration scheme for spectral caustic rendering. Our acceleration scheme takes into account information across visible wavelengths of the scene, that is, the index of refraction (IOR) (caustic object), light power (light), and material reflectance (surface). To process visible wavelengths effectively, firstly we cluster the wavelengths which have similar first refraction (air to caustic object) directions. In this way, all the wavelengths in a cluster can be represented by one light ray during rendering. Secondly, by considering the surrounding objects (their material reflectance from and visible surface area of the caustic objects) and light power, we compute the refinement amount of each wavelength cluster. Our accelerated algorithm can produce photorealistic rendering results close to their reference images (which are generated by rendering every 1 nm of visible wavelengths) with a significant acceleration magnitude.

The existing computer-generated lines, such as suggestive contours, apparent ridges, and demarcating curves, adopt the two-pass framework: in the first pass, certain geometric features or properties are extracted or computed in the object space; then in the second pass, the line drawings are rendered by iterating each polygonal face or edge. It is known these approaches are very sensitive to the mesh quality, and usually require appropriate preprocessing operations (e.g. smoothing, remeshing, etc.) to the input meshes. This paper presents a simple yet robust approach to generate view-dependent line drawings for 3D models. Inspired by the image edge detector, we compute the difference-of-Gaussian of illumination on the 3D model. With moderate assumption, we show all the expensive computations can be done in the pre-computing stage. Our method naturally integrates object- and image-spaces in that we compute the geometric features in the object space and then adopt a simple fragment shader to render the lines in the image space. As a result, our algorithm is more efficient than the existing object-space approaches, since the lines are generated in a single pass without iterating the mesh edges/faces. Furthermore, our method is more flexible and robust than the existing algorithms in that it does not require the preprocessing on the input 3D models.

The outlines of characters or objects on two key-frames are used as inputs. First, a skeleton linkage of the target object is automatically constructed by rasterizing each of input key-frames and then applying a pixel-based skeleton extraction method. Secondary, a pair of skeleton linkages having corresponding structure between the current key-frame and the next key-frame is constructed by applying the stroke matching algorithm. After these processes, motion transitions between the skeleton linkages are generated based on our simulation model. When the in-between frames are created only in the 2D plane, the outlines at in-between frames can be generated by a 2D deformation. In case that the in-between transitions are containing a rotation around an axis which is no perpendicular to the drawing plane, however, a 3D structure is required. For achieving such in-between transitions, our method constructs a 3D structure by inflating 2D mesh based on the input outlines. Finally, the contours from the view-point for the created 3D structure are projected onto the 2D plane during in-between transitions. In our method, we adopt the Photic Extremum Lines (PEL) to extract the 2D contours from the obtained 3D shape.

Based on the reconstructed 3D images of plant roots, the skeleton points and their radii are extracted by the Mini-crossing Section Algorithm (MCSA). Then the Many-knot Spline method is applied to interpolate a series of circles on the skeleton curve with some mesh points being sampled. The cross line of lateral and tap roots are also processed so that the mesh points of all roots could be connected smoothly. The geometric model that depicts the morphological traits is obtained by adding tiny roots and lighting the root surface. Our experimental results show that this modeling approach is very fast in computation and that the number of data points that determine the root morphology is several hundred times smaller than the original images. The root architecture model obtained by the algorithm is vivid. Compared to existing approaches, our algorithm is very robust on extracting skeleton points based on MCSA. As a result the surface morphology of roots is fitted efficiently to Ball Many-knot Spline."}, {"title": "CONEA: CONsumer Editable Animation", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=6QTmlnAAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=6QTmlnAAAAAJ:b1wdh0AR-JQC", "authors": ["Hock Soon Seah", "Feng Tian"], "publication_date": "2008/1/10", "conference": "2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference", "description": "Animation created using computer graphics is seen through a viewport which is dictated by what the director or producer wants the consumer to watch.

Virtual objects can be integrated into natural scenes after recovering planes in the scenes. To achieve this, feature detection and pruning are first used on the target images to reduce clutter in the scene.

Effective use of this imaging modality in clinics largely depends on the capability of real-time 3D image reconstruction, cell and tissue feature detection, and rendering. To match the video rate of image streaming, the online detection and rendering of the volumetric features implied by the cellular images has been proven technically challenging. Upon a comprehensive survey and comparative analysis, in this paper, we present a novel GPU-based solution to the real-time 3D feature detection and rendering, for an interactive visualization of the endomicroscopic images. We preprocess the acquired datasets by employing mathematical morphology with multiple render targets in a multi-pass approach on the GPU. A transfer function is defined online for the volume of interest (VOI), based on an automated local adaptive thresholding technology. The mechanism and GPU implementation techniques for dynamically generation of the transfer functions are presented. Advantages of this novel approach are shown in the experimental results."}, {"title": "DIRECT 3D STYLIZATION PIPELINES Real-Time Live!", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=6QTmlnAAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=6QTmlnAAAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC", "authors": ["Santiago Montesdeoca", "Hock Soon Seah", "Davide Benvenuti", "Hans-Martin Rall", "Pierre B\u00e9nard", "Jo\u00eblle Thollot", "Romain Vergne"], "description": "Direct 3D stylization pipelines Page 1 HAL Id: hal-01574958 https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01574958 Submitted on 17 Aug 2017 HAL is a multi-disciplinary open access archive for the deposit and dissemination of scientific research documents, whether they are published or not.

Existing works addressing route queries mainly focus on static road networks rather than timeaware road networks. Observe the fact that the same road segment can be driven at different speeds during different time intervals, and users usually prefer driving on a route that consumes minimum energy within a travel time budget. Motivated by this, this paper studies the energy-efficient time-aware routing problem in road networks, denoted as EETAR. We take time factor into consideration and utilize a piecewise constant speed model to calculate the travel time along each road segment with different departure time. We also utilize a polynomial energy cost model to compute the energy consumption along each road segment with different departure time. As the problem of EETAR is NP-hard, we propose an approximation algorithm with provable approximation bounds to answer the route queries in real-world dense road networks. In addition, we also devise a greedy route planning algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms can answer EETAR queries efficiently."}, {"title": "BEZIER CURVE-BASED SHAPE ENCODING FOR HAND-DRAWN IMAGES", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=6QTmlnAAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=6QTmlnAAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "authors": ["Jianmin Zheng", "Hock Soon Seah", "De-Wei Randall Lim"], "description": "In this paper we propose a method for encoding hand-drawn images based on a parametric B\u00e9zier representation. The method consists of two modules: vectorization of outlines of the hand-drawn image and encoding of B\u00e9zier curves. The former automatically extracts the outline of the image and generates composite B\u00e9zier curves that approximate the outline within a prescribed tolerance; and the latter efficiently encodes B\u00e9zier control points, resulting in a very compact file size. The technique described here is useful for many shape-based image processes and applications."}, {"title": "3D Painting via Polycube Geometry Images", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=6QTmlnAAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=6QTmlnAAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "authors": ["Huiqin Gu", "Ying He", "Hock-Soon Seah", "Feng Tian"], "description": "This paper aims at proposing a novel 3D painting technique via Polycube Geometry Images. Polycube Geometry Images is a global surface parameterization technique such that the parametric domain is a Polycube (cubical complex). Polycube is a highly regular structure that describes the 3D surface topology and geometry while keeping consistency of surface with low distortion. By unfolding the Polycube adjacent facets, 3D surface attributes, such as color and normal, can be stored and accessed in the Polycube Geometry Images as 2D image. For example, painting and applying image processing via Polycube Geometry Images on 3D surface indirectly. To achieve this goal, we first propose a graph-based representation of Polycube Geometry Images for flexible interactive unfolding. Second, unfolding algorithm suitable for general Polycube is developed.

In this paper, a lighting model is presented that attempts to enhance the shape depiction of 3D ob- jects.

For the traditional cartoon animation, artists and animators spend tremendous amount of time on drawing and painting frames. For 3D animation, artists first draft the storyboard and design characters. After that, programmers/artists model the characters, backgrounds, animate and render scenes with software tools like Maya or 3D Studio Max. The whole process is rather tedious and demands high computation power. To improve this"}]}
