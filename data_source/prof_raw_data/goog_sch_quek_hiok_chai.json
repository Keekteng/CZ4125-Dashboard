Similar membership functions (MFs) are merged by a specified similarity measure in an order of Hebbian importance, and the resultant equivalent \u2026", "total_citations": 71, "citation_graph": {"2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 9, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 8, "2012": 6, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}, {"title": "Backward fuzzy rule interpolation", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Tj-KsfQAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=Tj-KsfQAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "authors": ["Shangzhu Jin", "Ren Diao", "Chai Quek", "Qiang Shen"], "publication_date": "2014/1/29", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems", "description": "Fuzzy rule interpolation offers a useful means to enhancing the robustness of fuzzy models by making inference possible in sparse rule-based systems.

This solution uses IT2 membership functions for handling uncertainties, plus having Type-I (GSETSK) capabilities. In this way IT2-GSETSK is a fully-online model able to handle data streams and cope with time-variant data.

The collapse and failure of a bank could have devastating consequences to the entire banking system and a widespread repercussion effect on other banks and financial institutions. Some of the negative impacts are the massive bail out cost for a failing bank and the negative sentiments and loss of confidence developed by investors and depositors. Very often, bank failures do not occur over night and are usually due to a prolonged period of financial distress. Hence, it is desirable to have an early warning system that identifies potential failing or high-risk banks through financial distress. Various traditional statistical models have been employed to study bank failures [1]-[4]. However, these models have not identified the symptoms of financial distress leading to eventual bank failure. This paper attempts to identify the financial distress (the symptoms) that leads to a bank failure using financial covariates derived from publicly available financial statements using a novel neural fuzzy system named the Generic Selforganising Fuzzy Neural Network (GenSoFNN)[5]. Subsequently, the performance of the Cox proportional hazards model [3][4] is benchmarked against that of the GenSoFNN in predicting bank failures based on a population of 3635 US banks observed over a 21 years period.

The first group is essentially fuzzy systems with self-tuning capabilities and requires an initial rule base to be specified prior to training [2][3]. The second group of neural fuzzy networks, on the other hand, is able to automatically formulate the fuzzy rules from the numerical training data [4][5].

Hierarchical-based clustering techniques included single link [1], complete link [2] and [3][4]. The main drawback of hierarchical clustering is that it is static, and points committed to a given cluster in the early stages cannot be moved to a different cluster. Prototype-based partition clustering techniques, on the other hand, are dynamic and the data points can move from one cluster to another under varying conditions. However, partitionbased clustering techniques require prior knowledge such as the number of classes, C, in the set of training data. Such information may be unknown and is difficult to estimate in data sets such as traffic flow data [5]. For tasks such as the 2-Spiral problem [6], computing a predefined number of clusters, C, may not be good enough to satisfactorily solve the tasks. Moreover, partition-based clustering techniques suffer from the stability-plasticity dilemma [7] where new information cannot be learned without running the risk of eroding old (previously learned) but valid knowledge. Therefore, in the context of neural fuzzy systems [8] such as POPFNN [9], hierarchical clustering violates the networks\u2019 ability to self-organize and self-adapt with changing environments while current partition-based clustering techniques have some significant shortcomings.

The proposed IPS architecture constitutes in effect a generic framework for the building of online supervision and control systems, that allows in particular for the effective integration of both traditional and AI-based control techniques, while providing a high degree of reusability as well as portability."}, {"title": "TR\u2014Temporal reasoner", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Tj-KsfQAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=Tj-KsfQAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "authors": ["Chai Quek", "Abdul Wahab", "Wee-Chee Sim"], "publication_date": "1996/1/1", "journal": "Expert Systems with Applications", "description": "A constraint-based qualitative reasoning system that integrates Allen's interval calculus, point calculus and pan of Simmons' quantity lattice is presented in this paper.

While single-learner training-time attacks, capable of\" preprogramming\" behavioral triggers into a strategy, receive increasing attention, attacks on collections of learning agents have been largely overlooked. We remedy the situation by developing a constructive training-time attack on a population of learning agents and make the attack agnostic to the size of the population. The attack constitutes a sequence of environment (re) parameterizations (poisonings), generated to overcome individual differences between agents and lead the entire population to the same target behavior while minimizing effective environment modulation. Our method is demonstrated on populations of independent learners in\" ghost\" environments (learners do not interact or perceive each other) as well as environments with mutual awareness, with or without individual learning. From the attack perspective, we pursue an ultra-blackbox setting, ie, crosspolicy traces of the victim learners are the only input both for attack conditioning and attack evaluation during the attacker\u2019s training. To manage the resulting uncertainty in population behavior, we deploy a novel Wasserstein distance-based Gaussian embedding of detected behaviors within the population of victim learners. To align with prior works on environment poisoning, our experiments are based on a 3D Grid World domain and show: a) feasibility, ie, despite the uncertainty, the attack forces a population-wide adoption of target behavior; b) efficacy, ie, the attack is size-agnostic and \u2026"}, {"title": "Risk-Based Adaptive Stock Trading System Using Reinforcement Learning", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Tj-KsfQAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=Tj-KsfQAAAAJ:7BrZ7Jt4UNcC", "authors": ["Chai Quek", "Qi Cao"], "journal": "Available at SSRN 4237367", "description": "There is a significant amount of research in applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for performing stock trading. Most of these prior works aim to maximize trading profits. However, there is no single type of trader characteristics in stock markets. Different individuals are willing to tolerate differing risk levels in stock trading, which exhibit very different trading behaviors. Firstly, this paper develops a RL agent to model stock trading patterns for maximizing profits, achieved by buying stock near the troughs and selling stock near peaks. Secondly, it is enhanced with a risk-awareness stock trading model that enables tuning the level of risk appetite. This is achieved using a risksensitivity parameter and revising the Q-learning algorithm. The proposed risk-awareness stock trading model exhibits a full spectrum of trading behaviors, from risk-averse at one end of the spectrum, to risk-seeking at the other end. Trading behaviors under different risk-sensitivities have been validated against predictions made by the prospect theory, a leading theory for riskbased decision making. It is further validated against human trading behaviors from a user study involving 23 participants. The analysis results illustrate that the proposed risk-awareness trading model can cover wide ranging behavioral characteristics under different risk appetites. Different risk sensitivities are suitable to different stock market conditions. Thirdly, a risk-adaptive stock trading system is developed utilising the RL risk-awareness trading model. It can automatically switch its risk sensitivity profile depending on dynamic stock market conditions.

Variations of the signal properties from intra and inter sessions often lead to deteriorated BCI performances as features extracted by methods such as common spatial patterns (CSP) are not invariant against the changes. To extract features that are robust and invariant, this paper proposes a novel spatial filtering algorithm, called KLCSP. The CSP algorithm only considers the discrimination between the means of the classes, but does not consider within-class scatters information. In contrast, the proposed KLCSP algorithm simultaneously maximizes the discrimination between the class means, and minimizes the within-class dissimilarities measured by a new loss function based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The performance of the proposed KLCSP algorithm is evaluated on the publicly available BCI Competition III dataset IVa, and a large dataset from stroke patients performing neurorehabilitation. The results showed that the proposed KLCSP algorithm significantly outperformed the CSP algorithm in terms of the classification accuracy (p< 0. 01) by reducing within-class variations resulting in more compact and separable features."}, {"title": "and Cho, Siu-Yeung (2012) A novel framework for making dominant point detection methods non-parametric.
