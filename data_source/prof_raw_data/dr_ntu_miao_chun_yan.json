The apparatus autonomously tracks situational information comprising the existing level of work of the e-business, for each of multiple products and/or services offered by the business, and also a desired level of work. In this way, the recommendation protects both the reputation of the business and achieves work-life balance for the business owner."}, {"link": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20150278676A1/en", "title": "US 2015/0278676 A1", "abstract": ": The invention proposes that a software agent for assisting a user in a virtual environment defined by a first concept map, maintains a record of its experiences in the form of a second concept map. The concept maps are compared to obtain a measure of stimulation. The measure of stimulation is used to derive a comparison value indicative an emotional state of the user, and the comparison value is used in a reward function to guide the behavior of the software agent."}, {"link": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180012261A1/en", "title": "US 2018/0012261 A1", "abstract": ": A method and system are proposed for presenting information relating to a product to a potential customer for the product, upon the user scanning a 2D barcode using a mobile device. The information is presented to the customer as a story generated by an agent-based storytelling system. The story is personalized to the customer using online multimedia. It can be used to conduct mobile branding and advertisement, and is able thereby to augment offline shopping with online shopping experience."}, {"link": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170140409A1/en", "title": "US 2017/0140409 A1", "abstract": ": A computerized reward mechanism system is proposed which makes use both of presently collected data relating to the customer, and a database of historical data relating to the customer. Using this information, the system performs a customer preference analysis, which results in selecting rewards which are adapted to the customers' personal needs. In one form, the system is positioned at a shopping center, and includes cameras for recognising past customers by image processing. This may be done without requiring customers to participate in a process of signing up to use the system. The presently collected data include responses to questions put to the customer relating to his present shopping experience. Customer honesty is considered in the step of determining which rewards to offer the consumer, to encourage the consumers to express their feelings more clearly."}, {"link": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20150278688A1/en", "title": "US 2015/0278688 A1", "abstract": ": A remembrance agent is proposed, to be hosted on a wearable computer. The remembrance agent employs a first database (WK) of knowledge about the world in the form of concept maps. Events (\u201cepisodes\u201d) experienced by a user are each classified as relating to one or more of the concepts in WK. The episodes are used to produce a second database (episodic memory, EM), and the classification is also used to update a third database (semantic memory, SM) organised using the concepts. The semantic memory thus summarizes the user's interaction with the concepts during the episodes. A current situation of the user is classified according to the concepts, and the classification is used, with the EM and SM, to provide to the user information relevant to the current situation."}], "urls": {"dr_ntu": "https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00084", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0300-3448", "personal": null, "google_scholar": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fmXGRJgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao", "web_of_science": "https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/391057", "scopus": "https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=8850060600"}}
