However, the hallucinated details are often accompanied with unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the visual quality, we thoroughly study three key components of SRGAN\u2013network architecture, adversarial loss and perceptual loss, and improve each of them to derive an Enhanced SRGAN (ESRGAN). In particular, we introduce the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without batch normalization as the basic network building unit. Moreover, we borrow the idea from relativistic GAN to let the discriminator predict relative realness instead of the absolute value. Finally, we improve the perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which could provide stronger supervision for brightness consistency and texture recovery. Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed ESRGAN achieves consistently better visual quality with more realistic and natural textures than SRGAN and won the first place in the PIRM2018-SR Challenge (region 3) with the best perceptual index.

However, the high computational cost still hinders it from practical usage that demands real-time performance (24 fps). In this paper, we aim at accelerating the current SRCNN, and propose a compact hourglass-shape CNN structure for faster and better SR. We re-design the SRCNN structure mainly in three aspects.

In addition, it is intrinsically hard to learn a deep representation that is geometrically invariant to large pose variations. In this study, we hypothesize that there is an inherent mapping between frontal and profile faces, and consequently, their discrepancy in the deep representation space can be bridged by an equivariant mapping. To exploit this mapping, we formulate a novel Deep Residual EquivAriant Mapping (DREAM) block, which is capable of adaptively adding residuals to the input deep representation to transform a profile face representation to a canonical pose that simplifies recognition.

Consequently, the restoration is limited to using the same-scale information while neglecting potential high-resolution (HR) cues from other scales. In this paper, we explore the cross-scale patch recurrence property of a natural image, ie, similar patches tend to recur many times across different scales. This is achieved using a novel cross-scale internal graph neural network (IGNN). Specifically, we dynamically construct a cross-scale graph by searching k-nearest neighboring patches in the downsampled LR image for each query patch in the LR image. We then obtain the corresponding k HR neighboring patches in the LR image and aggregate them adaptively in accordance to the edge label of the constructed graph. In this way, the HR information can be passed from k HR neighboring patches to the LR query patch to help it recover more detailed textures.

Motivated by the observation that a 3D object should look realistic from multiple viewpoints, these methods introduce a multi-view constraint as regularization to learn valid 3D radiance fields from 2D images. Despite the progress, they often fall short of capturing accurate 3D shapes due to the shape-color ambiguity, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks. In this work, we address this ambiguity by proposing a novel shading-guided generative implicit model that is able to learn a starkly improved shape representation. Our key insight is that an accurate 3D shape should also yield a realistic rendering under different lighting conditions. This multi-lighting constraint is realized by modeling illumination explicitly and performing shading with various lighting conditions. Gradients are derived by feeding the synthesized images to a discriminator. To compensate for the additional computational burden of calculating surface normals, we further devise an efficient volume rendering strategy via surface tracking, reducing the training and inference time by 24% and 48%, respectively. Our experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed approach achieves photorealistic 3D-aware image synthesis while capturing accurate underlying 3D shapes.

This shortage makes their performance under expectation. Therefore, we contribute a pipeline, named transformation flow, to bridge the gap between single and multi-modality data augmentation with transformation reversing and replaying.

To balance the tradeoff between detail synthesis and artifact suppression, we found an image pre-cleaning stage indispensable to reduce noises and artifacts prior to propagation. Equipped with a carefully designed cleaning module, our RealBasicVSR outperforms existing methods in both quality and efficiency.

However, performing local transfer is difficult because of two gaps between input and reference images: the transformation gap (eg scale and rotation) and the resolution gap (eg HR and LR). To tackle these challenges, we propose C^ 2-Matching in this work, which produces explicit robust matching crossing transformation and resolution. 1) For the transformation gap, we propose a contrastive correspondence network, which learns transformation-robust correspondences using augmented views of the input image. 2) For the resolution gap, we adopt a teacher-student correlation distillation, which distills knowledge from the easier HR-HR matching to guide the more ambiguous LR-HR matching. 3) Finally, we design a dynamic aggregation module to address the potential misalignment issue.

Specifically, we leverage the facial landmarks as the geometric guidance to learn the differentiable flows automatically, despite of the large pose gap existed. Geometry-aware flow is able to warp the source face attribute into the target face context and generate a warp-and-blend result. To compensate for the potential appearance gap between source and target faces, we propose a hallucination sub-network that produces an appearance residual to further refine the warp-and-blend result. Finally, a cycle-consistency framework consisting of both attribute transfer module and attribute removal module is designed, so that abundant unpaired face images can be used as training data. Extensive evaluations validate the capability of our approach in transferring instance-level facial attributes faithfully across large pose and appearance gaps. Thanks to the flow representation, our approach can readily be applied to generate realistic details on high-resolution images 1.", "total_citations": 31, "citation_graph": {"2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 11, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}, {"title": "Discriminative Sparse Neighbor Approximation for Imbalanced Learning", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=559LF80AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=559LF80AAAAJ:MNNNGtAgD4EC", "authors": ["Chen Huang", "Chen Change Loy", "Xiaoou Tang"], "publication_date": "2018", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "description": "Data imbalance is common in many vision tasks where one or more classes are rare.

Instead of randomly inserting mask tokens to the input embeddings in the spatial domain, in this paper, we shift the perspective to the frequency domain. Specifically, MFM first masks out a portion of frequency components of the input image and then predicts the missing frequencies on the frequency spectrum. Our key insight is that predicting masked components in the frequency domain is more ideal to reveal underlying image patterns rather than predicting masked patches in the spatial domain, due to the heavy spatial redundancy. Our findings suggest that with the right configuration of mask-and-predict strategy, both the structural information within high-frequency components and the low-level statistics among low-frequency counterparts are useful in learning good representations. For the first time, MFM demonstrates that, for both ViT and CNN, a simple non-Siamese framework can learn meaningful representations even using none of the following: (i) extra data, (ii) extra model, (iii) mask token. Experimental results on ImageNet and several robustness benchmarks show the competitive performance and advanced robustness of MFM compared with recent masked image modeling approaches. Furthermore, we also comprehensively investigate the effectiveness of classical image restoration tasks for representation learning from a unified frequency perspective and reveal their intriguing relations with our MFM approach.

Nighttime flare removal is challenging because of the unique luminance and spectrum of artificial lights and the diverse patterns and image degradation of the flares captured at night. The scarcity of nighttime flare removal datasets limits the research on this crucial task. In this paper, we introduce, Flare7K, the first nighttime flare removal dataset, which is generated based on the observation and statistics of real-world nighttime lens flares. It offers 5,000 scattering and 2,000 reflective flare images, consisting of 25 types of scattering flares and 10 types of reflective flares. The 7,000 flare patterns can be randomly added to flare-free images, forming the flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs. With the paired data, we can train deep models to restore flare-corrupted images taken in the real world effectively. Apart from abundant flare patterns, we also provide rich annotations, including the labeling of light source, glare with shimmer, reflective flare, and streak, which are commonly absent from existing datasets.

Tiny neural networks have much fewer parameters and lower complexity, and thus should not be trained the same way as their large counterparts for DG applications. We find that knowledge distillation is a strong candidate for solving the problem: it outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods that were developed using large models with a large margin. Moreover, we observe that the teacher-student performance gap on test data with domain shift is bigger than that on in-distribution data. To improve DG for tiny neural networks without increasing the deployment cost, we propose a simple idea called out-of-distribution knowledge distillation (OKD), which aims to teach the student how the teacher handles (synthetic) out-of-distribution data and is proved to be a promising framework for solving the problem.

For different intents of using the objects, humans conduct various motions, which requires the human first to approach the objects and then make them move consistently with the human instead of staying still. Also, to deploy in downstream applications, the synthesized motions are desired to be flexible in length, providing options to personalize the predicted motions for various purposes.

TOHO generates human-object motions in three steps: 1) it first estimates the keyframe poses of conducting a task given the task type and object information; 2) then, it infills the keyframes and generates continuous motions; 3) finally, it applies a compact closed-form object motion estimation to generate the object motion.

Many existing methods rely on manually designed features to detect these bright spots, but they often fail to identify reflective flares created by various types of light and may even mistakenly remove the light sources in scenarios with multiple light sources. To address these challenges, we propose an optical center symmetry prior, which suggests that the reflective flare and light source are always symmetrical around the lens's optical center. This prior helps to locate the reflective flare's proposal region more accurately and can be applied to most smartphone cameras. Building on this prior, we create the first reflective flare removal dataset called BracketFlare, which contains diverse and realistic reflective flare patterns.

Our method inherits the zero-reference learning and curve-based framework from an effective low-light image enhancement method, Zero-DCE, with further speed up in its inference speed, reduction in its model size, and extension to controllable exposure adjustment. The improved inference speed and lightweight model are achieved through novel curve distillation that approximates the time-consuming iterative operation in the conventional curve-based framework by high-order curve's tangent line. The controllable exposure adjustment is made possible with a new self-supervised spatial exposure control loss that constrains the exposure levels of different spatial regions of the output to be close to the brightness distribution of an exposure map serving as an input condition. Different from most existing methods that can only correct either underexposed or overexposed photos, our approach corrects both underexposed and overexposed photos with a single model. Notably, our approach can additionally adjust the exposure levels of a photo globally or locally with the guidance of an input condition exposure map, which can be pre-defined or manually set in the inference stage. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method is appealing for its fast, robust, and flexible performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in real scenes.

Existing flare removal approaches mainly focus on removing daytime flares and fail in nighttime cases. Nighttime flare removal is challenging due to the unique luminance and spectrum of artificial lights, as well as the diverse patterns and image degradation of the flares. The scarcity of the nighttime flare removal dataset constraints the research on this crucial task. In this paper, we introduce Flare7K++, the first comprehensive nighttime flare removal dataset, consisting of 962 real-captured flare images (Flare-R) and 7,000 synthetic flares (Flare7K). Compared to Flare7K, Flare7K++ is particularly effective in eliminating complicated degradation around the light source, which is intractable by using synthetic flares alone. Besides, the previous flare removal pipeline relies on the manual threshold and blur kernel settings to extract light sources, which may fail when the light sources are tiny or not overexposed. To address this issue, we additionally provide the annotations of light sources in Flare7K++ and propose a new end-to-end pipeline to preserve the light source while removing lens flares. Our dataset and pipeline offer a valuable foundation and benchmark for future investigations into nighttime flare removal studies.

Second, following the design of depth-wise convolution, we create a corresponding depth-wise vision Transformer that is more efficient with comparable performance.

While most existing studies focus on HPS from 2D images or videos with inherent depth ambiguity, there are surging need to investigate HPS from 3D point clouds as depth sensors have been frequently employed in commercial devices. However, real-world sensory 3D points are usually noisy and incomplete, and also human bodies could have different poses of high diversity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a principled framework, PointHPS, for accurate 3D HPS from point clouds captured in real-world settings, which iteratively refines point features through a cascaded architecture. Specifically, each stage of PointHPS performs a series of downsampling and upsampling operations to extract and collate both local and global cues, which are further enhanced by two novel modules: 1) Cross-stage Feature Fusion (CFF) for multi-scale feature propagation that allows information to flow effectively through the stages, and 2) Intermediate Feature Enhancement (IFE) for body-aware feature aggregation that improves feature quality after each stage. To facilitate a comprehensive study under various scenarios, we conduct our experiments on two large-scale benchmarks, comprising i) a dataset that features diverse subjects and actions captured by real commercial sensors in a laboratory environment, and ii) controlled synthetic data generated with realistic considerations such as clothed humans in crowded outdoor scenes.

Existing image deblurring methods predominantly focus on global deblurring, inadvertently affecting the sharpness of backgrounds in locally blurred images and wasting unnecessary computation on sharp pixels, especially for high-resolution images. This paper aims to adaptively and efficiently restore high-resolution locally blurred images. We propose a local motion deblurring vision Transformer (LMD-ViT) built on adaptive window pruning Transformer blocks (AdaWPT). To focus deblurring on local regions and reduce computation, AdaWPT prunes unnecessary windows, only allowing the active windows to be involved in the deblurring processes. The pruning operation relies on the blurriness confidence predicted by a confidence predictor that is trained end-to-end using a reconstruction loss with Gumbel-Softmax re-parameterization and a pruning loss guided by annotated blur masks. Our method removes local motion blur effectively without distorting sharp regions, demonstrated by its exceptional perceptual and quantitative improvements (+0.24dB) compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our approach substantially reduces FLOPs by 66% and achieves more than a twofold increase in inference speed compared to Transformer-based deblurring methods.

However, these methods often fall short when faced with complex degradations as they generally cannot be precisely modeled. In this paper, we propose PGDiff by introducing partial guidance, a fresh perspective that is more adaptable to real-world degradations compared to existing works. Rather than specifically defining the degradation process, our approach models the desired properties, such as image structure and color statistics of high-quality images, and applies this guidance during the reverse diffusion process. These properties are readily available and make no assumptions about the degradation process. When combined with a diffusion prior, this partial guidance can deliver appealing results across a range of restoration tasks. Additionally, PGDiff can be extended to handle composite tasks by consolidating multiple high-quality image properties, achieved by integrating the guidance from respective tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing diffusion-prior-based approaches but also competes favorably with task-specific models."}, {"title": "DeformToon3D: Deformable 3D Toonification from Neural Radiance Fields", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=559LF80AAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=559LF80AAAAJ:wuYnf3tzzDUC", "authors": ["Junzhe Zhang", "Yushi Lan", "Shuai Yang", "Fangzhou Hong", "Quan Wang", "Chai Kiat Yeo", "Ziwei Liu", "Chen Change Loy"], "publication_date": "2023", "conference": "IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision", "description": "In this paper, we address the challenging problem of 3D toonification, which involves transferring the style of an artistic domain onto a target 3D face with stylized geometry and texture. Although fine-tuning a pre-trained 3D GAN on the artistic domain can produce reasonable performance, this strategy has limitations in the 3D domain. In particular, fine-tuning can deteriorate the original GAN latent space, which affects subsequent semantic editing, and requires independent optimization and storage for each new style, limiting flexibility and efficient deployment. To overcome these challenges, we propose DeformToon3D, an effective toonification framework tailored for hierarchical 3D GAN. Our approach decomposes 3D toonification into subproblems of geometry and texture stylization to better preserve the original latent space. Specifically, we devise a novel StyleField that predicts conditional 3D deformation to align a real-space NeRF to the style space for geometry stylization. Thanks to the StyleField formulation, which already handles geometry stylization well, texture stylization can be achieved conveniently via adaptive style mixing that injects information of the artistic domain into the decoder of the pre-trained 3D GAN. Due to the unique design, our method enables flexible style degree control and shape-texture-specific style swap.
