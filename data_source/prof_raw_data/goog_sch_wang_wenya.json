In this paper, we propose a deep-learning based inductive logic reasoning method that firstly extracts query-related (candidate-related) information, and then conducts logic reasoning among the filtered information by inducing feasible rules that entail the target relation. The reasoning process is accomplished via attentive memories with novel differentiable logic operators. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we evaluate it on two reading comprehension datasets, namely WikiHop and MedHop.", "total_citations": 4, "citation_graph": {"2023": 4}}, {"title": "Vera: A General-Purpose Plausibility Estimation Model for Commonsense Statements", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eOKISncAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=eOKISncAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "authors": ["Jiacheng Liu", "Wenya Wang", "Dianzhuo Wang", "Noah A Smith", "Yejin Choi", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi"], "publication_date": "2023/5/5", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.03695", "description": "Despite the much discussed capabilities of today's language models, they are still prone to silly and unexpected commonsense failures. We consider a retrospective verification approach that reflects on the correctness of LM outputs, and introduce Vera, a general-purpose model that estimates the plausibility of declarative statements based on commonsense knowledge. Trained on ~7M commonsense statements created from 19 QA datasets and two large-scale knowledge bases, and with a combination of three training objectives, Vera is a versatile model that effectively separates correct from incorrect statements across diverse commonsense domains. When applied to solving commonsense problems in the verification format, Vera substantially outperforms existing models that can be repurposed for commonsense verification, and it further exhibits generalization capabilities to unseen tasks and provides well-calibrated outputs. We find that Vera excels at filtering LM-generated commonsense knowledge and is useful in detecting erroneous commonsense statements generated by models like ChatGPT in real-world settings.", "total_citations": 1, "citation_graph": {"2023": 1}}, {"title": "Interpretable Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Logic Reasoning", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eOKISncAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=eOKISncAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "authors": ["Hui Liu", "Wenya Wang", "Haoliang Li"], "publication_date": "2023", "journal": "Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2023", "description": "Multimodal misinformation on online social platforms is becoming a critical concern due to increasing credibility and easier dissemination brought by multimedia content, compared to traditional text-only information. While existing multimodal detection approaches have achieved high performance, the lack of interpretability hinders these systems' reliability and practical deployment. Inspired by NeuralSymbolic AI which combines the learning ability of neural networks with the explainability of symbolic learning, we propose a novel logic-based neural model for multimodal misinformation detection which integrates interpretable logic clauses to express the reasoning process of the target task. To make learning effective, we parameterize symbolic logical elements using neural representations, which facilitate the automatic generation and evaluation of meaningful logic clauses. Additionally, to make our framework generalizable across diverse misinformation sources, we introduce five meta-predicates that can be instantiated with different correlations. Results on three public datasets (Twitter, Weibo, and Sarcasm) demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of our model.", "total_citations": 1, "citation_graph": {"2023": 1}}, {"title": "Progressive Multigranularity Information Propagation for Coupled Aspect-Opinion Extraction", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eOKISncAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=eOKISncAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "authors": ["Fengmao Lv", "Tao Liang", "Zhihui Fei", "Wenya Wang"], "publication_date": "2022/10/28", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "description": "Coupled aspect-opinion extraction aims to identify aspect-opinion pairs in the form of (aspect term, opinion term) or triplets in the form of (aspect term, opinion term, sentiment polarity) from user-generated texts. Compared to the traditional aspect-based sentiment prediction or extraction tasks, coupled aspect-opinion extraction needs to associate aspects with their corresponding opinions and organize opinion-related information into structured outputs. The existing works either divide this task into subproblems (i.e., term extraction and relation prediction) or utilize a unified tagging scheme. However, these methods only focus on atomic word-level interactions and ignore the intensive information propagation among different granularities (e.g., words and word pairs).

The emergence of opinion mining techniques comes along with the excessive volume of text data from social media made available to the public, such as product reviews, blog posts, forum discussions and Twitter website for social network. Sentiment analysis has been actively studied among the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community since 2000. At this early stage, the main focus of sentiment analysis dealt with the overall sentiment polarity towards a given sentence or document, which we call coarse-grained sentiment analysis. For example, given a review sentence: \"The sound is clean and clear\", the desired output should be positive, without knowing the exact object the reviewer is talking about. For this task, various machine learning classifiers and deep learning models were developed to learn opinion-bearing features for the whole sentence or document to make predictions. However, a mere sentiment score is far from enough to provide all the necessary information for decision making. That's the reason why fine-grained opinion mining becomes more popular in a later stage. Fine-grained opinion mining, or aspect-based sentiment analysis, mainly focuses on finding the opinion targets (aspects) from a given sentence and the emotions expressed towards them. This is more related to information extraction. Take the previous example review sentence, the model should be able to extract sound as the aspect and clean and clear as the opinion. The extracted information can be \u2026"}]}
