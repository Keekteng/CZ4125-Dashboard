BACKGROUND For safety-critical embedded systems, an increasing trend is to integrate multiple independent functionalities on a single shared computing platform; this trend is evident in industry-driven initiatives and standards such as ARINC653 [1] and IMA and AUTOSAR [2] in automotive. However among all the functionalities in a system, only some functionalities are critical for the correctness of the system and need to be certificated by statutory certification authorities (CAs) and the rest of the functionalities will not influence the safety of the system to the same extent. Under normal conditions, all tasks providing different functionalities will receive enough processing resource. But more critical tasks should be given preference if something abnormal happens in the system (ie when tasks exceed their expected worst-case execution times (WECTs)[3] which in fact is highly unlikely to happen). Such systems comprised of tasks of different criticalities are called mixed-criticality (MC) systems. In many previous studies of mixed-criticality real-time systems, the model proposed by Vestal is widely used [3]. In this model, a task can be specified as \u0442i=(Ti, Li, ci, Di), where Ti denotes minimum separation between job releases, Li denotes criticality level based on the task\u2019s importance to the system, ci= c1 i, c2 i,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, cmax i is a list of WCET values measured with different degrees of confidence (here cj i denotes \u0442i\u2019s WCET when the system is at criticality level j), and Di (\uf8ff Ti) denotes \u0442i\u2019s deadline.

This structure makes embedded systems amenable to compositional design. Real-time embedded systems consist of real-time workloads having temporal deadlines. Compositional design of real-time embedded systems can be done using systems consisting of real-time components arranged in a scheduling hierarchy. Each component consists of some real-time workload and a scheduling policy for the workload. To simplify schedulability analysis for such systems, analysis can be done compositionally using interfaces that abstract the timing requirements of components. To facilitate analysis of dynam-ically changing real-time systems, the framework must support incremental analysis. In this paper, we summarize our work [19, 6] on schedulability analysis for hierarchical real-time systems. We describe a compositional analysis technique that abstracts resource requirements of components using periodic resource models. To support incremental analysis and resource bandwidth minimization, we describe an extension to this interface model. Each extended interface consists of multiple periodic resource models for different periods. This allows the selection of a periodic model that can schedule the system using minimum bandwidth. We also account for context switch overheads in these interfaces.

For both components, there is a tradeoff between non-functional and functional performance, and both impact a vehicle's safety. For instance, giving an OOD detector a longer response time can increase its accuracy at the expense of the LEC. We consider an LEC with binary output like an autonomous emergency braking system (AEBS) and use risk, the combination of severity and occurrence of a failure, to model the effect of both components' design parameters on each other's functional and non-functional performance, as well as their impact on system safety. We formulate a co-design methodology that uses this risk model to find the design parameters for an OOD detector and LEC that decrease risk below that of the baseline system and demonstrate it on a vision based AEBS.

An important challenge in designing MCS is to handle uncertainties in the execution behaviour such as a budget overrun of a software element (or task) in a safe and effective manner. For this purpose, functional safety standards such as ISO 26262 [1] specify a set of rules and rigorous process which necessitate the system design to incorporate sufficient mechanisms to prevent the propagation of faults from tasks certified to lower criticality level to tasks certified to higher criticality level. A majority of the existing MCS task models (reviewed in [2]) consider criticality to denote the relative importance of a task and use it to achieve graceful degradation of the system either by suspending or degrading tasks with relatively lower criticality level than the overloading task. As pointed out in [3], notion of criticality as the relative importance of a task may be appropriate only for dual-criticality MCS models (where a task can be either high critical or low critical). For instance, it has been observed that in a system with 4 criticality levels, to handle budget overrun of any task at criticality level 4 (highest), degradation of tasks with criticality level 3 may not be acceptable. As stated in [4], the notion of criticality, relative importance and degradation of a functionality in an MCS should be loosely coupled entities.

However, this simple triggering logic can expose large amounts of irregular instruction-level parallelism that can be hard to manage. This thesis addresses this challenge in three steps: (1) design of a lightweight scheduling circuit inside each DaCO soft-processor that enables large- scale out-of-order instruction execution at runtime, (2) design of a priority-aware communication framework that delivers improved quality of service to critical communication packets, and (3) compiler support that optimizes the dataflow graph structure for improved runtime execution.
