Therefore, an MPP tracking (MPPT) scheme is implemented between the PV system and the load to obtain maximum power. When the irradiance distribution on the PV arrays is uniform, many traditional MPPT techniques can track the MPP effectively. However, when the PV arrays are partially shaded, multiple MPPs show up, which usually results in the failure of finding the global MPP. Some researchers have reported this problem and tried to solve it, but most of the MPP control schemes are relatively complicated or fail to guarantee the MPP under all shading circumstances. In order to overcome this difficulty, this paper presents a novel ant colony optimization (ACO)-based MPPT scheme for PV systems.

In this aspect, the N-modular redundancy (NMR) is widely used. An NMR system is comprised of N identical systems, the corresponding outputs of which are majority voted to generate the system outputs. To perform majority voting, a majority voter is required, and the sizes of majority voters tend to vary depending on an NMR system. Majority voters corresponding to NMR systems are physically realized by enumerating the majority input clauses corresponding to an NMR system and then synthesizing the majority logic equation. The issue is that the number of majority input clauses corresponding to an NMR system is governed by a mathematical combination, the complexity of which increases substantially with increases in the level of redundancy. In this context, the design of a majority voter of any size corresponding to an NMR specification based on a new, generalized design approach is described. The proposed approach is inherently hierarchical and progressive since any NMR majority voter can be constructed from an (N \u2212 2)MR majority voter along with additional logic corresponding to the two extra inputs.

However, the proposal was restricted to the basic implementation with no provision for indicating the correct or the incorrect operation of the MMR. Hence in this work, we present the MMR scheme with the error/no-error signaling logic (ESL).

In a TMR implementation, two identical copies of a function module are used in addition to the original function module, and the correct operation of at least two function modules is required. In TMR, the corresponding primary outputs of the three function modules are combined using majority voters, which determine the actual primary outputs based on the Boolean majority. Hence, the majority voter is an important component that is useful for conveying the correct operation of a TMR implementation. In the existing literature, many designs of three-input majority voters for TMR have been discussed.

In a monotonic asynchronous circuit, the intermediate and primary outputs exhibit similar signal transitions as the primary inputs during data and spacer application. The proposed asynchronous full adder ensures monotonicity for processing data and spacer, utilizing dual-rail encoding for inputs and outputs, and corresponds to return-to-zero (RtZ) and return-to-one (RtO) handshaking. The early output feature of the proposed full adder allows the production of sum and carry outputs based on the adder inputs regardless of the carry input when the spacer is supplied. When utilized in a ripple carry adder (RCA) architecture, the proposed full adder achieves significant reductions in design metrics, such as cycle time, area, and power, compared to existing IOM asynchronous full adders. For a 32-bit RCA implementation using a 28 nm CMOS technology, the proposed full adder outperforms an existing state-of-the-art high-speed asynchronous full adder by reducing the cycle time by 10.4% and the area by 15.8% for RtZ handshaking and reduces the cycle time by 9.8% and the area by 15.8% for RtO handshaking without incurring any power penalty.

Traditionally, triple modular redundancy (TMR) has been used to ensure complete tolerance to any single fault or a faulty processing unit, where the processing unit may be a circuit or a system. However, TMR incurs more than 200% overhead in terms of area and power compared to a single processing unit. Alternative redundancy approaches have been proposed in the literature to mitigate these overheads associated with TMR, but they provide only partial or moderate fault tolerance. Among the alternatives, majority voting-based reduced precision redundancy (MVRPR) may be useful for error-resilient applications such as digital signal processing. While MVRPR guarantees only moderate fault tolerance, the proposed FAC is well-suited for error-resilient applications and ensures 100% tolerance to any single fault or a faulty processing unit, like TMR. In this work, we evaluate the performance of TMR, MVRPR, and FAC for a digital image processing application. The image processing results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of FAC. Moreover, when the processing unit is implemented using a 28-nm CMOS technology, FAC achieves significant improvements over TMR, including a 15.3% reduction in delay, a 19.5% reduction in area, and a 24.7% reduction in power.

To derive an efficient mapping onto this type of architecture, we have designed fine-grained parallel processing elements (PEs) that are tailored towards the parameters of a query.

The algorithm is insensitive to variations in the amplitudes of the input signals, and does not require an accurate estimate of the frequency of the input sinusoids.

The Run-Time Reconfiguration (RTR) of the FPGA as an application is being served provides further flexibility. It gives the opportunity to reuse FPGA space used by custom computing circuits that are not operational in a given time frame. Custom computing circuits can meet very tight real-time requirements but when it comes to reconfiguring these circuits, the time taken can be comparatively long and non-deterministic. There is a need for a suitable development environment to investigate how to cope with or reduce the RTR time. This paper describes how this can be achieved with currently available tools and technologies. We first review an appropriate subset of the available technology to implement a system comprising a CPU running a RTOS on a SoPC that can \u00e9be adapted using RTR. Then we propose a system architecture that is feasible with current technology. We outline the processes and databases needed to support RTR of the SoPC. We present how the RTOS is made aware of the architectural constraints and reconfiguration options, thus simplifying the use of reconfigurable hardware for the application programmer."}, {"title": "A discrete-time quadrature time-of-arrival estimator for determining the subsample delay between narrowband ultrasound signals", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=o_roEHkAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=o_roEHkAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "authors": ["DL Maskell", "GS Woods"], "publication_date": "2002/10/8", "conference": "2002 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium, 2002.

The runtime failures of these critical components can lead to system shutdown and sometimes cause severe damage to the whole PV energy system. In practice, the electrolytic capacitor employed in the PV inverter is responsible for the majority of run-time failures. Thus, to improve the reliability of PV systems, condition monitoring of the electrolytic capacitor is necessary. Since buck-boost converter is beneficial for extracting the full available power from a PV module, it is very useful in some PV systems. This paper proposes an on-line condition monitoring algorithm for DC-link capacitors in the buck-boost converters. The proposed algorithm utilizes recursive least squares estimation. Compared to the estimations based on the least mean squares, it is more accurate. Comprehensive theoretical analysis is provided for the proposed algorithm.
