Dennard scaling. As the performance density of traditional CPU-centric architectures stagnates, advancing compute capabilities necessitates novel architectural approaches. Near-memory processing (NMP) architectures are reemerging as promising candidates to improve computing efficiency through tight coupling of logic and memory. NMP architectures are especially fitting for data analytics, as they provide immense bandwidth to memory-resident data and dramatically reduce data movement, the main source of energy consumption. Modern data analytics operators are optimized for CPU execution and hence rely on large caches and employ random memory accesses. In the context of NMP, such random accesses result in wasteful DRAM row buffer activations that account for a significant fraction of the total memory access energy. In addition, utilizing NMP\u2019s ample bandwidth with fine-grained random accesses requires complex hardware that cannot be accommodated under NMP\u2019s tight area and power constraints. Our thesis is that efficient NMP calls for an algorithm-hardware co-design that favors algorithms with sequential accesses to enable simple hardware that accesses memory in streams. We introduce an instance of such a co-designed NMP architecture for data analytics, the Mondrian Data Engine.

In serverless, developers compose their cloud services as a set of functions while providers take responsibility for scaling each function\u2019s resources according to traffic changes. Hence, the provider needs to timely spawn, or tear down, function instances (i.e., HTTP servers with user-provider handles), which cannot hold state across function invocations. Performance of a modern serverless cloud is bound by data movement. Serverless architecture separates compute resources and data management to allow function instances to run on any node in a cloud datacenter. This flexibility comes at the cost of the necessity to move function initialization state across the entire datacenter when spawning new instances on demand. Furthermore, to facilitate scaling, cloud providers restrict the serverless programming model to stateless functions (which cannot hold or share state across different functions), which lack efficient support for cross-function communication. This thesis consists of four following research contributions that pave the way for a data-centric serverless cloud architecture. First, we introduce STeLLAR, an opensource serverless benchmarking framework, which enables an accurate performance characterization of serverless deployments. Using STeLLAR, we study three leading serverless clouds and identify that all of them follow the same conceptual architecture that comprises three essential subsystems, namely the worker fleet, the scheduler, and the storage.

However, developing and evaluating serverless systems in a research setting (ie,\u201cin-vitro\u201d, without access to a largescale production cluster and real workloads) is challenging yet vital for innovation. Recently, several serverless providers have released production traces consisting of large sets of functions with their invocation inter-arrival time, execution time, and memory footprint distributions. However, executing the workload synthesized from these traces requires a massive cluster, making experiments expensive and timeconsuming."}, {"title": "Expedited Data Transfers for Serverless Clouds", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=cZ9jA9oAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=cZ9jA9oAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "authors": ["Dmitrii Ustiugov", "Shyam Jesalpura", "Mert Bora Alper", "Michal Baczun", "Rustem Feyzkhanov", "Edouard Bugnion", "Boris Grot", "Marios Kogias"], "publication_date": "2023/9/26", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.14821", "description": "Serverless computing has emerged as a popular cloud deployment paradigm. In serverless, the developers implement their application as a set of chained functions that form a workflow in which functions invoke each other. The cloud providers are responsible for automatically scaling the number of instances for each function on demand and forwarding the requests in a workflow to the appropriate function instance. Problematically, today's serverless clouds lack efficient support for cross-function data transfers in a workflow, preventing the efficient execution of data-intensive serverless applications. In production clouds, functions transmit intermediate, i.e., ephemeral, data to other functions either as part of invocation HTTP requests (i.e., inline) or via third-party services, such as AWS S3 storage or AWS ElastiCache in-memory cache. The former approach is restricted to small transfer sizes, while the latter supports arbitrary transfers but suffers from performance and cost overheads. This work introduces Expedited Data Transfers (XDT), an API-preserving high-performance data communication method for serverless that enables direct function-to-function transfers. With XDT, a trusted component of the sender function buffers the payload in its memory and sends a secure reference to the receiver, which is picked by the load balancer and autoscaler based on the current load. Using the reference, the receiver instance pulls the transmitted data directly from the sender's memory. XDT is natively compatible with existing autoscaling infrastructure, preserves function invocation semantics, is secure, and avoids the cost and performance overheads of \u2026"}, {"title": "Messages from SESAME\u201923 Organizers", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=cZ9jA9oAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=cZ9jA9oAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "authors": ["Dmitrii Ustiugov", "Rodrigo Bruno", "Pedro Fonseca", "Boris Grot", "Antonio Barbalace"], "description": "In this short paper we investigate the combination of two emerging technologies: the tight provisioning requirements of Serverless computing and the acceleration potential of FPGAs. Serverless platforms suffer from container overheads, notably cold start latency, while having to adapt to Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) workloads. By exploring re-configurability of FPGAs and their acceleration power, we propose an innovative light-weight Serverless platform for FPGA-based FaaS applications which aims to reduce these overheads. In this study, we explore the feasibility of the idea by implementing key elements of such platform onto the FPGA. Our initial results show potential for acceleration in all aspects of function invocation."}]}
