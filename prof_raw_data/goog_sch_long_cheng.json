Unfortunately, existing exact algorithms have severe scalability problems and existing approximate algorithms, though scalable, cannot guarantee near-to-optimal solutions. In this paper, we study the CoSKQ problem and address the above issues.\nFirstly, we consider the CoSKQ problem using an existing cost measurement called the maximum sum cost. This problem is called MaxSum-CoSKQ and is known to be NP-hard.
