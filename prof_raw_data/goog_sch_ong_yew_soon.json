Extensive experiments on COCO show that ORL significantly improves the performance of self-supervised learning on scene images, even surpassing supervised ImageNet pre-training on several downstream tasks.

Instead of randomly inserting mask tokens to the input embeddings in the spatial domain, in this paper, we shift the perspective to the frequency domain. Specifically, MFM first masks out a portion of frequency components of the input image and then predicts the missing frequencies on the frequency spectrum. Our key insight is that predicting masked components in the frequency domain is more ideal to reveal underlying image patterns rather than predicting masked patches in the spatial domain, due to the heavy spatial redundancy. Our findings suggest that with the right configuration of mask-and-predict strategy, both the structural information within high-frequency components and the low-level statistics among low-frequency counterparts are useful in learning good representations. For the first time, MFM demonstrates that, for both ViT and CNN, a simple non-Siamese framework can learn meaningful representations even using none of the following: (i) extra data, (ii) extra model, (iii) mask token. Experimental results on ImageNet and several robustness benchmarks show the competitive performance and advanced robustness of MFM compared with recent masked image modeling approaches. Furthermore, we also comprehensively investigate the effectiveness of classical image restoration tasks for representation learning from a unified frequency perspective and reveal their intriguing relations with our MFM approach.

Considering the power of implicit parallelism, we are drawn to the idea that population-based search strategies provide an idyllic setting for leveraging the underlying synergies between objective function landscapes of seemingly distinct optimization tasks, particularly when they are solved together in a unified space with a single population of evolving individuals. Allowing the principles of evolution to autonomously exploit the available synergies can often lead to accelerated convergence for otherwise complex tasks.

Unlike traditional batch learning methods for maximizing AUC which often suffer from poor scalability, recent years have witnessed some emerging studies that attempt to maximize AUC by single-pass online learning approaches. Despite their encouraging results reported, the existing online AUC maximization algorithms often adopt simple online gradient descent approaches that fail to exploit the geometrical knowledge of the data observed during the online learning process, and thus could suffer from relatively larger regret. To address the above limitation, in this work, we explore a novel algorithm of Adaptive Online AUC Maximization (AdaOAM) which employs an adaptive gradient method that exploits the knowledge of historical gradients to perform more informative online learning. The new adaptive updating strategy of the AdaOAM is less sensitive to the parameter settings and maintains the same time complexity as previous non-adaptive counterparts.

One of the important design issues of MAs is the choice of individuals produced by the global search method upon which the local search procedure should be applied. Selecting only some potential individuals lessens the demand for functional evaluations hence accelerates convergence to the global optimum.

More importantly, the EP approach is inherently a parallel search algorithm, making it amenable to exploit the immense computational resources that a grid computing architecture can provide.

Different from previous attention-based graph neural networks (GNNs), JATs adopt novel joint attention mechanisms which can automatically determine the relative significance between node features and structural coefficients learned from graph subspace, when computing the attention scores. Therefore, representations concerning more structural properties can be inferred by JATs. Besides, we theoretically analyze the expressive power of JATs and further propose an improved strategy for the joint attention mechanisms that enables JATs to reach the upper bound of expressive power which every message-passing GNN can ultimately achieve, i.e., 1-WL test. JATs can thereby be seen as most powerful message-passing GNNs. The proposed neural architecture has been extensively tested on widely used benchmarking datasets, including Cora, Cite, and Pubmed and has been compared with state-of-the-art GNNs for node classification tasks.

In the literature, the existing approaches can generally be categorized as decomposition-based methods and dimension-reduction-based methods. The former decomposes a large-scale problem into several smaller subproblems, while the latter transforms the original high-dimensional solution space into a low-dimensional space. However, it is worth noting that a given large-scale optimization problem may not always be decomposable, and it is also difficult to guarantee that the global optimum of the original problem is preserved in the reduced low-dimensional problem space. This paper thus proposes a new search paradigm, namely the multi-space evolutionary search, to enhance the existing evolutionary search methods for solving large-scale optimization problems. In contrast to existing approaches that perform an evolutionary search in a single search space, the proposed paradigm is designed to conduct a search in multiple solution spaces that are derived from the given problem, each possessing a unique landscape. The proposed paradigm makes no assumptions about the large-scale optimization problem of interest, such as that the problem is decomposable or that a certain relationship exists among the decision variables.

The solution is obtained by optimizing a deep neural network whose loss function is defined by the residual terms from the differential equations. Recent studies have used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) variants to train these physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), but these methods can struggle to find accurate solutions due to optimization challenges. When solving differential equations, it is important to find the globally optimum parameters of the network, rather than just finding a solution that works well during training. SGD only searches along a single gradient direction, so it may not be the best approach for training PINNs with their accompanying complex optimization landscapes. In contrast, evolutionary algorithms perform a parallel exploration of different solutions in order to avoid getting stuck in local optima and can potentially find more accurate solutions. However, evolutionary algorithms can be slow, which can make them difficult to use in practice. To address this, we provide a set of five benchmark problems with associated performance metrics and baseline results to support the development of evolutionary algorithms for enhanced PINN training. As a baseline, we evaluate the performance and speed of using the widely adopted Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) for solving PINNs.

There has thus been the apparent lack of automated knowledge transfers and reuse across problems.

The learning operator mines for memes in the form of latent structures derived from past experiences of problem-solving. The selection operator identifies the fit memes that replicate and transmit across problems, while the variation operator introduces innovations into the memes. The imitation operator, on the other hand, defines how fit memes assimilate into the search process of newly encountered problems, thus gearing towards efficient and effective evolutionary optimization.

This is exacerbated as PINNs need to balance multiple objectives, comprising the governing PDEs, associated boundary/initial conditions, and/or point data. Under this multi-objective optimization framework, the ideal PINN solution is one that achieves zero loss across all components although this is not typical, resulting in a Pareto set of models. Nonetheless, there are objectively-preferred models based on congruence to unknown ground truth. In this context, we propose a Pareto front-based analysis to help identify better performing models. First, an approximation to the Pareto set of solutions with minimal PINN loss is constructed for different balances of loss weights. A loss weight located on the convex bulge of the Pareto front is then selected to rescale the training loss across all solutions.

MDP is limited by the Markovian assumption that a reward only depends on the immediate state and action. However, a reward sometimes depends on the history of states and actions, which may result in the decision process in a non-Markovian environment. In such environments, agents receive rewards via temporally-extended behaviors sparsely, and the learned policies may be similar. This leads the agents acquired with similar policies generally overfit to the given task and can not quickly adapt to perturbations of environments. To resolve this problem, this paper tries to learn the diverse policies from the history of state-action pairs under a non-Markovian environment, in which a policy dispersion scheme is designed for seeking diverse policy representation. Specifically, we first adopt a transformer-based method to learn policy embeddings. Then, we stack the policy embeddings to construct a dispersion matrix to induce a set of diverse policies. Finally, we prove that if the dispersion matrix is positive definite, the dispersed embeddings can effectively enlarge the disagreements across policies, yielding a diverse expression for the original policy embedding distribution. Experimental results show that this dispersion scheme can obtain more expressive diverse policies, which then derive more robust performance than recent learning baselines under various learning environments."}, {"title": "LSA-PINN: Linear Boundary Connectivity Loss for Solving PDEs on Complex Geometry", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=h9oWOsEAAAAJ&cstart=400&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=h9oWOsEAAAAJ:6IBXqrN-DEwC", "authors": ["Jian Cheng Wong", "Pao-Hsiung Chiu", "Chinchun Ooi", "My Ha Dao", "Yew-Soon Ong"], "publication_date": "2023/2/3", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.01518", "description": "We present a novel loss formulation for efficient learning of complex dynamics from governing physics, typically described by partial differential equations (PDEs), using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).

However, in reality, data usually reside in distributed parties such as different institutions and may not be directly gathered and integrated due to various data policy constraints. As a result, some parties may suffer from insufficient data available for training machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a multi-party dual learning (MPDL) framework to alleviate the problem of limited data with poor quality in an isolated party. Since the knowledge sharing processes for multiple parties always emerge in dual forms, we show that dual learning is naturally suitable to handle the challenge of missing data, and explicitly exploits the probabilistic correlation and structural relationship between dual tasks to regularize the training process. We introduce a feature-oriented differential privacy with mathematical proof, in order to avoid possible privacy leakage of raw features in the dual inference process. The approach requires minimal modifications to the existing multi-party learning structure, and each party can build flexible and powerful models separately, whose accuracy is no less than non-distributed self-learning approaches.

Existing studies usually assume that the learned new feature representation is \\emph{domain-invariant}, and thus train a transfer model on the source domain. In this paper, we consider a more realistic scenario where the new feature representation is suboptimal and small divergence still exists across domains. We propose a new transfer model called Randomized Transferable Machine (RTM) to handle such small divergence of domains. Specifically, we work on the new source and target data learned from existing feature-based transfer methods. The key idea is to enlarge source training data populations by randomly corrupting the new source data using some noises, and then train a transfer model that performs well on all the corrupted source data populations. In principle, the more corruptions are made, the higher the probability of the new target data can be covered by the constructed source data populations, and thus better transfer performance can be achieved by . An ideal case is with infinite corruptions, which however is infeasible in reality. We develop a marginalized solution that enables to train an without conducting any corruption but equivalent to be trained using infinite source noisy data populations. We further propose two instantiations of , which theoretically show the transfer superiority over the conventional transfer model . More importantly, both instantiations have closed-form solutions, leading to a fast and efficient training process.

However, few of them consider how the quantification of dichotomous inclination w.r.t. network topology and vertex features may influence vertex-cluster preferences, which deters previous methods from uncovering more interpretable latent groups in network data. To fill this void, we propose a novel probabilistic model, dubbed Relational Thematic Clustering with Mutually Preferred Neighbors (RTCMPN). Different from prevalent approaches which predetermine the learning significance of edge structure and vertex features, RTCMPN can further learn the latent preferences indicating which neighboring vertices are more possible to be in the same cluster, and the dichotomous inclinations describing how relative significance w.r.t. edge structure and vertex features may impact the association between pairwise vertices. Therefore, cluster structure implanted with edge structure, vertex features, neighboring preferences, and vertex-vertex dichotomous inclinations can be learned by RTCMPN.

The key idea is to learn high dimensional network motifs from low dimensional forms through a process of transfer learning. In contrast to previous work, we facilitate positive transfer by introducing a triangular inequality constraint, which provides a measure for the feasibility of mapping between different motif manifolds.

Since EAs typically require thousands of function evaluations to locate a near optimal solution, the use of EAs often becomes computationally prohibitive for this class of problems.

This paper proposed the conceptual modeling of a memetic ant colony system (MACS) for believable resource gathering in RTS games. In the proposed MACS, the harvester's path-finding and resource gathering knowledge captured are extracted and represented as memes, which are internally encoded as state transition rules (mem- otype), and externally expressed as ant pheromone on the graph edge (sociotype). Through the inter-play between the memetic evolution and ant colony, harvesters as memetic automatons spawned from an ant colony are able to acquire increasing level of capability in exploring complex dynamic game environment and gathering resources in an adaptive manner, producing consistent and impressive resource gathering behaviors."}, {"title": "Evolution by adapting surrogates", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=h9oWOsEAAAAJ&cstart=400&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=h9oWOsEAAAAJ:JdL-Xu2nR38C", "authors": ["Yew Soon Ong", "Minh Nghia Le", "Stefan Menzel", "Yaochu Jin", "Bernhard Sendhoff"], "publication_date": "2013", "description": "To deal with complex optimization problems plagued with computationally expensive fitness functions, the use of surrogates to replace the original functions within the evolutionary framework is becoming a common practice. However, the appropriate datacentric approximation methodology to use for the construction of surrogate model would depend largely on the nature of the problem of interest, which varies from fitness landscape and state of the evolutionary search, to the characteristics of search algorithm used. This has given rise to the plethora of surrogate-assisted evolutionary frameworks proposed in the literature with ad hoc approximation/surrogate modeling methodologies considered. Since prior knowledge on the suitability of the data centric approximation methodology to use in surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization is typically unavailable beforehand, this paper presents a novel evolutionary framework with the evolvability learning of surrogates (EvoLS) operating on multiple diverse approximation methodologies in the search. Further, in contrast to the common use of fitness prediction error as a criterion for the selection of surrogates, the concept of evolvability to indicate the productivity or suitability of an approximation methodology that brings about fitness improvement in the evolutionary search is introduced as the basis for adaptation. The backbone of the proposed EvoLS is a statistical learning scheme to determine the evolvability of each approximation methodology while the search progresses online.

This paper focuses on memetic computing optimization algorithms and proposes a counter-tendency approach for algorithmic design. Research in the field tends to go in the direction of improving existing algorithms by combining different methods or through the formulation of more complicated structures. Contrary to this trend, we instead focus on simplicity, proposing a structurally simple algorithm with emphasis on processing only one solution at a time. The proposed algorithm, namely three stage optimal memetic exploration, is composed of three memes; the first stochastic and with a long search radius, the second stochastic and with a moderate search radius and the third deterministic and with a short search radius. The bottom-up combination of the three operators by means of a natural trial and error logic, generates a robust and efficient optimizer, capable of competing with modern complex and computationally expensive algorithms. This is suggestive of the fact that complexity in algorithmic structures can be unnecessary, if not detrimental, and that simple bottom-up approaches are likely to be competitive is here invoked as an extension to memetic computing basing on the philosophical concept of Ockham\u2019s Razor.

Numerous efforts have been made to define the job of a data scientist in a qualitative manner by, for example, listing the job functions and required skill sets of data scientists. However, to the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to define the term data scientist in a scientific manner. In this paper, we address this issue by using a data-driven approach to answer three questions: 1) What is a proper definition of the term data scientist from a market-demand perspective? 2) Do self-described data scientists meet the market demand? and 3) Finally, how can companies efficiently recruit data scientists that match their openings? To answer these questions, we crawl two data sets for the supply and demand sides. For the former, we collect a set of data scientist user profiles from LinkedIn; for the latter, we collect a set of \u2026"}, {"title": "Welcome from the Technical Program Chairs", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=h9oWOsEAAAAJ&cstart=500&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=h9oWOsEAAAAJ:RJujIP1NYNUC", "authors": ["Ivor Tsang", "Yew-Soon Ong", "Hussein Abbass", "Liang Feng", "Guang Yang", "Wei Liu"], "description": "Papers submitted to IEEE CAI 2023 were designed to be short abstracts of 1-2 pages in length (possibly 3-4 max) that if accepted could be easily converted into a poster presentation at the conference.

After all, the ability to perform logical reasoning over language remains a coveted goal of Artificial Intelligence. To this end, models such as the Turing-complete differentiable neural computer (DNC) boast of real logical reasoning capabilities, along with the ability to reason beyond simple surface-level matching. In this brief, we propose the first probe into DNC\u2019s logical reasoning capabilities with a focus on text-based question answering (QA). More concretely, we propose a conceptually simple but effective adversarial attack based on metamorphic relations. Our proposed adversarial attack reduces DNCs\u2019 state-of-the-art accuracy from 100% to 1. 5% in the worst case, exposing weaknesses and susceptibilities in modern neural reasoning architectures.

In general, the difficulty of a problem exponentially increases with the number of objectives, serving as a clear example of the curse of dimensionality. The exploratory approach an EA takes in these cases has led to it being thought of as a big data generator, progressively sampling and evaluating solutions in high performing regions of a decision space to guide the search towards optimal solutions. Notably, in both multi-and many-objective EAs, the data samples can be further utilized for building inverse models, mapping points in objective space back to solutions in the decision space. Such models offer immense flexibility to a decision maker in generating new target solutions on the fly, thereby facilitating real-time a posteriori preference incorporation. In this paper, we show that the data generated from a many-objective optimization search is in fact more conducive to inverse modeling than its multi-objective counterpart (where the output space is compressed via synthetic objective aggregation)\u2013highlighting a rare blessing of dimensionality that has yet to be explored in the context of optimization. We first present simple theoretical arguments supporting this statement. Thereafter, experimental studies of Gaussian process-based inverse modeling for a pedagogical and a practical composite manufacturing example are carried out to further confirm the theory."}, {"title": "Unsupervised Object-Level Representation Learning from Scene Images Supplementary Material", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=h9oWOsEAAAAJ&cstart=500&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=h9oWOsEAAAAJ:EsrhoZGmrkoC", "authors": ["Jiahao Xie", "Xiaohang Zhan", "Ziwei Liu", "Yew Soon Ong", "Chen Change Loy"], "description": "Image classification with linear models.

One key strength of ELM is the significantly low computational time required for training new classifiers since the weights of the hidden and output nodes are randomly chosen and analytically determined, respectively. In this paper, we address the architectural design of the ELM classifier network, since too few/many hidden nodes employed would lead to underfitting/overfitting issues in pattern classification. In particular, we describe the proposed pruned-ELM (P-ELM) algorithm as a systematic and automated approach for designing ELM classifier network. P-ELM uses statistical methods to measure the relevance of hidden nodes. Beginning from an initial large number of hidden nodes, irrelevant nodes are then pruned by considering their relevance to the class labels. As a result, the architectural design of ELM network classifier can be automated. Empirical study of P-ELM on several commonly used classification benchmark problems and with diverse forms of hidden node functions show that the proposed approach leads to compact network classifiers that generate fast response and robust prediction accuracy on unseen data, comparing with traditional ELM and other popular machine learning approaches. r 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved."},

PINNs typically constrain their training loss function with differential equations to ensure outputs obey underlying physics. These differential operators are typically computed via automatic differentiation (AD), but this can fail with insufficient collocation points. Hence, the idea of coupling both AD and numerical differentiation (ND) is employed. The proposed coupled-automatic-numerical differentiation scheme (can-PINN) strongly links collocation points, thus enabling efficient training while being more accurate than simply using ND. As a demonstration, two instantiations of can-PINN were derived for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and applied to modeling of liddriven flow in a cavity. Results show that can-PINNs can achieve very good accuracy even when the corresponding AD-based PINN fails."}, {"title": "Welcome Message from the General Chairs", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=h9oWOsEAAAAJ&cstart=500&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=h9oWOsEAAAAJ:VnuxuLaQPLMC", "authors": ["Kay Chen Tan", "Yew Soon Ong"], "description": "This year we received a total of 153 high-quality papers from more than 20 countries.
