Anatomical and functional MRI images of the brain have been used to understand the functional connectivity of the human brain and are particularly important in identifying underlying neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Autism. Recently, the study of the brain in the form of brain networks using machine learning and graph analytics has become increasingly popular, especially to predict the early onset of these conditions. A brain network, represented as a graph, retains richer structural and positional information that traditional examination methods are unable to capture. However, the lack of brain network data transformed from functional MRI images prevents researchers from data-driven explorations. One of the main difficulties lies in the complicated domain-specific preprocessing steps and the exhaustive computation required to convert data from MRI images into brain networks. We bridge this gap by collecting a large amount of available MRI images from existing studies, working with domain experts to make sensible design choices, and preprocessing the MRI images to produce a collection of brain network datasets. The datasets originate from 5 different sources, cover 3 neurodegenerative conditions, and consist of a total of 2,642 subjects.

This makes the graph representations learnt less effective in the downstream classification.

We first investigate different kinds of connectivities existing in a local neighborhood and identify a substructure called union subgraph, which is able to capture the complete picture of the 1-hop neighborhood of an edge.

By infusing the encoded neighbor connectivities, we propose a novel model, namely Union Subgraph Neural Network (UnionSNN), which is proven to be strictly more powerful than 1-WL in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs.
