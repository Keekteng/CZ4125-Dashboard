T-spline control grids permit T-junctions, so lines of control points need not traverse the entire control grid. T-splines support many valuable operations within a consistent framework, such as local refinement, and the merging of several B-spline surfaces that have different knot vectors into a single gap-free model. The paper focuses on T-splines of degree three, which are C2 (in the absence of multiple knots). T-NURCCs (Non-Uniform Rational Catmull-Clark Surfaces with T-junctions) are a superset of both T-splines and Catmull-Clark surfaces. Thus, a modeling program for T-NURCCs can handle any NURBS or Catmull-Clark model as special cases. T-NURCCs enable true local refinement of a Catmull-Clark-type control grid: individual control points can be inserted only where they are needed to provide additional control, or to \u2026", "total_citations": 1287, "citation_graph": {"2004": 8, "2005": 18, "2006": 33, "2007": 25, "2008": 33, "2009": 41, "2010": 59, "2011": 62, "2012": 87, "2013": 70, "2014": 80, "2015": 105, "2016": 87, "2017": 110, "2018": 74, "2019": 93, "2020": 93, "2021": 64, "2022": 74, "2023": 54}}, {"title": "T-spline simplification and local refinement", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=sGCf2k0AAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=sGCf2k0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "authors": ["Thomas W Sederberg", "David L Cardon", "G Thomas Finnigan", "Nicholas S North", "Jianmin Zheng", "Tom Lyche"], "publication_date": "2004/8/1", "journal": "ACM transactions on graphics (TOG)", "description": "A typical NURBS surface model has a large percentage of superfluous control points that significantly interfere with the design process.
