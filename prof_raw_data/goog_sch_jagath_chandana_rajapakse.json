This paper investigates the stability of sparse auto-regressive models of building GRN from gene expression data. Criteria for evaluating the stability of estimating GRN structure are proposed. Thereby, stability of multivariate vector autoregressive (MVAR) methods - ridge, lasso, and elastic-net - of building GRN were studied by simulating temporal gene expression datasets on scale-free topologies as well as on real data gathered over Hela cell-cycle. Effects of the number of time points on the stability of constructing GRN are investigated.

At least, the number of time points equal to the number of genes in the network are needed to achieve decent accuracy and stability of the networks.

We therefore propose a systematic probabilistic framework on fusing GE data and transitive protein interaction data to coherently build GRN. We use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to soft-cluster GE data, allowing overlapping cluster memberships. Next, a heuristic method is proposed to extend sparse PPIN by incorporating transitive linkages. We then propose a novel way to score extended protein interactions by combining topological properties of PPIN and correlations of GE. Following this, GE data and extended PPIN are fused using a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) in order to identify gene regulatory pathways and refine interaction scores that are then used to constrain the GRN structure. We employ a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture (BGM) model to refine the GRN derived from GE data by using the structural priors derived from GHMM. Experiments on real yeast regulatory networks demonstrate both the feasibility of the extended PPIN in predicting transitive protein interactions and its effectiveness on improving the coverage and accuracy the proposed method of fusing PPIN and GE to build GRN.

There are few existing solutions that can combine both multi-modal imaging and multi-omics datasets to derive neurological insights. We propose a deep neural network architecture that combines both structural and functional connectome data with multi-omics data for disease classification. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) are used to model functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data simultaneously to learn compact representations of the connectome. A separate set of GCNs are then used to model multi-omics datasets, expressed in the form of patient similarity networks, and combine them with latent representations of the connectome. An attention mechanism is used to fuse the GCN outputs, which provides insights on which omics data contributed most to the model's classification decision. We demonstrate our methods for Parkinson's disease (PD) classification by using datasets from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI).

Validating time delays from knowledge bases is a challenge since the vast majority of biological databases do not record temporal information of gene regulations. Biological knowledge and facts on gene regulations are typically extracted from bio-literature with specialized methods that depend on the regulation task. In this paper, we mine evidences for time delays related to the transcriptional regulation of yeast from the PubMed abstracts. Since the vast majority of abstracts lack quantitative time information, we can only collect qualitative evidences of time delays. Specifically, the speed-up or delay in transcriptional regulation rate can provide evidences for time delays (shorter or longer) in GRN. Thus, we focus on deriving events related to rate changes in transcriptional regulation. A corpus of yeast regulation related abstracts was manually labeled with such events. In order to capture these events automatically, we create an ontology of sub-processes that are likely to result in transcription rate changes by combining textual patterns and biological knowledge. We also propose effective feature extraction methods based on the created ontology to identify the direct evidences with specific details of these events.

Brain regions of interest are then detected through measuring the oxygenation level variations in blood vessels near the neurons activated by the input stimulus, ie, the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast. The detection of brain activation provides functional maps exhibiting which brain regions correspond to specific sensory or cognitive tasks. In fMRI experiments, the BOLD signal (or the hemodynamic response) changes resulted from neural activities follow the pattern of input stimulus, but are usually contaminated by high-level noises (Bandettini et al., 1993). Hence, it is important to develop analysis methods that can robustly detect activated brain regions from the noisy fMRI time series."}, {"title": "Stability of inferring gene regulatory structure with dynamic Bayesian networks", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=9WPWHiEAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=9WPWHiEAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "authors": ["Jagath C Rajapakse", "Iti Chaturvedi"], "publication_date": "2011", "conference": "Pattern Recognition in Bioinformatics: 6th IAPR International Conference, PRIB 2011, Delft, The Netherlands, November 2-4, 2011.

Assuming scale-free topologies, sample datasets are drawn from DBN to evaluate the stability of estimating the structure of GRN. Our experiments indicate although high accuracy can be achieved with equal number of time points to the number of genes in the network, the presence of large numbers of false positives and false negatives deteriorate the stability of building GRN.

The weighting parameter that comes with the NURBS de nition is explored to attract the surface into the regions showing high curvature. The weight at each control point is adjusted automatically according to the curvature properties of the evolving surface.

Existing structured light illumination based methods allowing wide-field visualization of the focal plane while rejecting out-of-focus background \u201chaze\u201d. While these methods are able to improve image contrast, the loss of out-of-focal plane photons limits the final image signal-tonoise ratio (SNR). Additionally, if the contrast of the projected grid is low this reduces the modulation and provides the weaker sectioning capability and as a result reduces the photons of the reconstructed optically sectioned image. The proposed method seeks to better utilize the lost photons by using the \u2018prior knowledge\u2019about the optical transfer function of the structured light illumination. By utilizing a maximum likelihood approach, the most likely fluorophores distribution in 3D can be identified that will produce the observed image stacks under structured and uniform illumination using an iterative maximization algorithm.

Most techniques perform the detection of activation in spatial and tempor al domains separately. Simultaneous analysis is ideal for analyzing the fMRI images as they account for the information distributed between both domains. Such simultaneous analysis of fMRI is referred to as spatiotemporal analysis. Benali et. al.[1] have introduced a spatiotemporal technique using the fixed effect model as an extension to principal component analysis (PCA). Distinguishing feature in this technique is the ability to incorporate the spatial and temporal domain prior knowledge into the modeling approach by incorporating into the covariance structure. However, this technique is only applicable to input stimulus having equal durations of ON and OFF states (symmetric experiments). Our present studies extend this technique to be able to detect activation in non-symmetric experiments."}, {"title": "IEEE/ACM TCBB", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=9WPWHiEAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=9WPWHiEAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "authors": ["E Mossel", "S Roch", "M Steel", "J Ma", "MN Nguyen", "JC Rajapakse", "R Maitra", "S Narasimhan", "R Rengaswamy", "R Vadigepalli"], "description": "Provides instructions and guidelines to prospective authors who wish to submit manuscripts."}]}
