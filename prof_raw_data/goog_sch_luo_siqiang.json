Given a graph with n nodes and if we model the distributed computation model as the well-known congested clique model, the state-of-the-art algorithm takes O (\u221a logn) communication rounds to approximate the PageRank value of each node in G, with a probability at least 1\u2212 1/n. In this paper, we present improved distributed algorithms for computing PageRank. Particularly, our algorithm performs O (log log\u221a n) rounds (a significant improvement compared with O (\u221a logn) rounds) to approximate the PageRank values with a probability at least 1\u2212 1/n. Moreover, under a reasonable assumption, our algorithm also reduces the edge bandwidth (ie, the maximum communication message size that can be exchanged through an edge during a communication round) by a O (logn) factor compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm. Finally, we show that our algorithm can be adapted to efficiently compute another variant of PageRank, ie, the batch one-hop Personalized PageRanks, in O (log logn) communication rounds.", "total_citations": 18, "citation_graph": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}, {"title": "Spiking graph convolutional networks", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ZDwbMg4AAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=ZDwbMg4AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "authors": ["Zulun Zhu", "Jiaying Peng", "Jintang Li", "Liang Chen", "Qi Yu", "Siqiang Luo"], "publication_date": "2022/5/5", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.02767", "description": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) achieve an impressive performance due to the remarkable representation ability in learning the graph information.
