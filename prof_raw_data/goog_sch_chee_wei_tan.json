This paper presents a class of feedback-control algorithms that proactively protect a network server from overload by installing rate throttles in a set of upstream routers. A control-theoretical framework is proposed to optimize the control setting such that throttling can be achieved in a distributed and fair manner. We develop control-theoretic algorithms that (1) are highly adaptive by avoiding the configuration of unnecessary control parameters, (2) provide max-min fairness for any number of throttling routers, (3) respond very quickly to network changes, (4) are extremely robust against extrinsic factors beyond the system control, and (5) are stable under given delay bounds.", "total_citations": 2, "citation_graph": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1}}, {"title": "MEGA: Machine Learning-Enhanced Graph Analytics for Infodemic Risk Management", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G2CBtcAAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=G2CBtcAAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "authors": ["Ching Nam Hang", "Pei-Duo Yu", "Siya Chen", "Chee Wei Tan", "Guanrong Chen"], "publication_date": "2023/9/15", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic brought not only global devastation but also an unprecedented infodemic of false or misleading information that spread rapidly through online social networks.

A framework that leverages cloud computing is key to designing scalable data analytics for infodemic control. This paper proposes the MEGA framework, which is a novel joint hierarchical clustering and parallel computing technique that can be used to process a variety of computational tasks in large graphs. Its unique feature lies in using statistical machine learning to exploit the inherent statistics of data to accelerate computation. Our MEGA framework consists of first pruning, followed by hierarchical clustering based on geodesic distance and then parallel computing, lending itself readily to parallel computing software, eg, MapReduce or Hadoop. In particular, we illustrate how our MEGA framework computes two representative graph problems for infodemic control, namely network motif counting for community detection and network centrality computation for rumor source detection. Interesting special cases of optimal tuning in the MEGA framework are identified based on geodesic distance characterization and random graph model analysis.

In this paper, we present an overview of a Perron-Frobenius theoretic framework to overcome the notorious non-convexity barriers in wireless utility maximization problems. Through this approach, the optimal value and solution of the optimization problems can be analytically characterized by the spectral property of matrices induced by nonlinear positive mappings. It also provides a systematic way to derive distributed and fast-convergent algorithms and to evaluate the fairness of resource allocation. This approach can even solve several previously open problems in the wireless networking literature, e.g., Kandukuri and Boyd (TWC 2002), Wiesel, Eldar and Shamai (TSP 2006), Krishnan and Luss (WCNC 2011).

Though seemingly nonconvex, we show that these problems can be solved using an optimization decomposition where each user calculates a payment for a given resource allocation, and the network uses the payment to optimize the performance of the user. We study three important examples of this utility maximization, namely the weighted sum logarithmic SINR maximization, the weighted sum inverse SINR minimization and the weighted sum logarithmic reliability maximization. These problems have hitherto been solved suboptimally in the literature.

We study the feasibility of the total energy consumption minimization problem subjecting to power budget and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) constraints. Finding the largest set of secondary users (i.e., the system capacity) that can be supported in the system is hard to solve due to the nonconvexity of the cardinality objective. We formulate this problem as a vector-cardinality optimization problem, and propose a convex relaxation that replaces the objective with a continuous and convex function. Motivated by the sum-of-infeasibilities heuristic, a joint power and admission control algorithm is proposed to compute the maximum number of secondary users that can \u2026"}, {"title": "Optimality Certificate in Dynamic Spectrum Management over DSL networks", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G2CBtcAAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=G2CBtcAAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "authors": ["Paschalis Tsiaflakis", "Chee Wei Tan", "Yung Yi", "Mung Chiang", "Marc Moonen"], "publication_date": "2008", "conference": "IEEE ISIT 2008", "description": "DSpace at KOASAS: Optimality Certificate in Dynamic Spectrum Management over DSL networks KOASAS menu About KOASAS KAIST Library \uac80\uc0c9 Advanced Search Browse Communities & Collections Researchers at KAIST Titles Subject By Date rss_1.0 rss_2.0 atom_1.0 sherpa SEARCH DSpace at KOASAS College of Engineering(\uacf5\uacfc\ub300\ud559)School of Electrical Engineering(\uc804\uae30\ubc0f\uc804\uc790\uacf5\ud559\ubd80)EE-Conference Papers(\ud559\uc220\ud68c\uc758\ub17c\ubb38) Optimality Certificate in Dynamic Spectrum Management over DSL networks Cited 0 time in webofscience Cited 0 time in scopus Hit : 267 Download : 0 Export DC(XML) Excel Tsiaflakis, Paschalis / Tan, Chee Wei / Yi, Yungresearcher / Chiang, Mung / Moonen, Marc Publisher IEEE Issue Date 2008 Language ENG Citation IEEE ISIT 2008 URI http://hdl.handle.net/10203/160457 Appears in Collection EE-Conference Papers(\ud559\uc220\ud68c\uc758\ub17c\ubb38) Files in This Item There are no files associated \u2026"}, {"title": "The FAST Copper Project: Fundamental Research in Fiber/DSL Broadband Access", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G2CBtcAAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=G2CBtcAAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "authors": ["Mung Chiang", "Jianwei Huang", "Dahai Xu", "Yi Yung", "Chee Wei Tan", "Raphael Cendrillon"], "publication_date": "2006/9/29", "conference": "Forty-Fourth Annual Allerton Conference", "description": "This is an overview of the ongoing FAST Copper project, which aims at at substantial improvements in rate, reach, reliability, and quality in copper-last-mile broadband access through fiber/DSL deployment, engineering innovations, and fundamental research.

This leads to tractable solutions for meeting queueing delay specifications of a number of flows. Using this model, we address the feasibility problem of whether the mean delays required by a set of inelastic flows can be guaranteed in WLANs.
