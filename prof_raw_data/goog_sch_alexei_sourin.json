Many approaches address the issue of unlabelled datasets by tightly coupling machine learning algorithms with interactive visualisations. Using appropriate techniques, analysts can play an active role in a highly interactive and iterative machine learning process to label the dataset and create meaningful partitions. While this principle has been implemented either for unsupervised, semi-supervised, or supervised machine learning tasks, the combination of all three methodologies remains challenging. In this paper, a visual analytics approach is presented, combining a variety of machine learning capabilities with four linked visualisation views, all integrated within the mVis (multivariate Visualiser) system. The available palette of techniques allows an analyst to perform exploratory data analysis on a multivariate dataset and divide it into meaningful labelled partitions, from which a classifier can be built. In the workflow, the analyst can label interesting patterns or outliers in a semi-supervised process supported by active learning. Once a dataset has been interactively labelled, the analyst can continue the workflow with supervised machine learning to assess to what degree the subsequent classifier has effectively learned the concepts expressed in the labelled training dataset. Using a novel technique called automatic dimension selection, interactions the analyst had with dimensions of the multivariate dataset are used to steer the machine learning algorithms.

There are two phases in our framework: pre-processing and simulation. In the pre-processing phase, the fvisual-collision binding is built based on the computation of geodesic paths. In the simulation phase, the cutting paths are detected on the collision triangles and then mapped to local 2D coordinates systems in which the intersections between visual mesh and the cutting paths are calculated. Both collision and visual meshes are then re-meshed locally. The visual-collision binding is updated after cutting, based on which the collision-simulation and visual-simulation embedding are updated locally.

While these systems allow to specify buildings in immense detail, roofs still pose a problem. Fully automatic roof generation algorithms might not yield desired results (especially for reconstruction purposes), and complete manual specification can get very tedious due to complex geometric configurations.

We have proposed an approach that allows for defining geometry, visual appearance and tangible physical properties of virtual objects by using mathematical formulas. It allows the learners to get immersed within the 3D scene and explore the shapes which are being modeled visually and haptically. We illustrate this concept with our function-based extension of X3D and VRML. Besides definition of objects with mathematical functions straight in the scene file, standard X3D and VRML objects can be converted into tangible ones as well as augmented with function-defined visual appearances.

For each mesh patch, four boundary condition curves are calculated via the parameterization for local PDE patch construction. Considering the boundary curves as shape control boundary curve conditions, a PDE patch can be built and its coefficients are evaluated from the boundary curves.

In particular, we discuss how function based PDE surfaces can be readily integrated within VRML and X3D environments."}, {"title": "RENDERING-ON-DEMAND SERVICE ACROSS HETEROGENEOUS GRID ENVIRONMENT", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "authors": ["BU-SUNG LEE", "ALEXEI SOURIN", "CLEMENT CHIA LIANG TIEN", "CHAN KAI YUAN", "TERENCE HUNG", "QUOC-THUAN HO", "JIE WEI", "DANNY OH", "STEVEN MILLER", "JUNWEI ZHANG", "ANTHONY CHONG", "K LEVINSKI"], "publication_date": "2007", "book": "GCA 2007", "description": "Rendering of images is a very compute intensive task.

The model depends on a representative physical property of the alveolar region termed the effective diffusivity, a function of the diffusivity, solubility, morphology and interface topography of each alveolar constituent. Unfortunately, the direct determination of the effective diffusivity of the alveolar region is impractical because of the difficulty in describing the internal geometry of each alveolar constituent. However, the transient solution of the macroscopic model can be used in conjunction with the lung-diffusing capacity (measured in a clinical setting) to determine the effective diffusivity of the alveolar region. With the effective diffusivity known, the three-dimensional effects of red blood-cell distribution on the lung-diffusing capacity can be predicted via numerical simulations. The results, obtained for normal (random), uniform, center-cluster, cornercluster, and several chain-like distributions, reveal a strong relationship between the type of red-cell distribution and the lung-diffusing capacity. The model developed has been used in order to study the impact of microscopic particles whose presence in the alveolar region may affect the lung-diffusing capacity. Clusters of particles were distributed according to the Poisson distribution with a different distribution parameter (the average number of particles per cluster)."}, {"title": "Virtual Campus of Nanyan Technological University", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "authors": ["Alexei Sourin"], "publication_date": "2006", "book": "Encyclopedia of Virtual Communities and Technologies", "description": "Nanyang in Chinese means \u201csouth seas\u201d \u00bea reference to the Southeast Asian region.

These initial conditions can significantly vary depending on the flow conditions in the conductive zone of the respiratory duct and the physical properties of the duct itself. Thus, for instance, the presence of solid micro-particles or other volatile components in the breathing air can affect the alveolar performance. Therefore, a numerical simulation of the \"two-phase\" air flow is necessary in order to determine the entrance conditions in the alveolar region.

As a result, when teaching subjects richly infused with geometry and mathematics it is usually a challenge for the learners to follow the instructor and visualize how mathematical concepts reflect in 3D geometry and colors. We have proposed an approach that allows for defining geometry, visual appearance and tangible physical properties of virtual objects by using mathematical formulas. It allows the learners to get immersed within the 3D scene and explore the shapes which are being modeled visually and haptically. We illustrate this concept with our function-based extension of X3D and VRML. Besides definition of objects with mathematical functions straight in the scene file, standard X3D and VRML objects can be converted into tangible ones as well as augmented with \u2026"}, {"title": "Combinatorial 3-Manifolds from Sets of Tetrahedra", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "authors": ["Lei Wei", "A Sourin", "O Sourina"], "book": "2007 International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW'07)", "description": "We seek to further expand the shared collaborative potential of cyberworlds by using haptic force- feedback in shared virtual scenes. We propose how to define density of the objects, together with their geometry and appearance, by using mathematical functions. We illustrate this concept by developing software which allows us to touch and feel surfaces of VRML and X3D objects, convert them to solid objects as well as create any other solid objects using the function-based extension of VRML and X3D. We define geometry, appearance and density of the solid objects by implicit, explicit and parametric functions straight in the VRML/X3D code or in dynamic-link libraries. Since the function-based models are small in size, it is possible to perform their collaborative interactive modifications with concurrent synchronous visualization at each client computer with any required level of detail. We illustrate the proposed with several application examples."}, {"title": "Poster Track Chair Message", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "authors": ["Alexei Sourin"], "description": "The following topics are dealt with: feature extraction; electroencephalography; learning (artificial intelligence); medical signal processing; virtual reality; data visualisation; solid modelling; computational geometry; neurophysiology; computer games."}, {"title": "General Track Chair Message", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "authors": ["Alexei Sourin"], "description": "Created intentionally or spontaneously, cyberworlds are information spaces and communities that use computer technologies to augment the way we interact, participate in business and receive information throughout the world.
