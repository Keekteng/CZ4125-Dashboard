Instead of taking a reactive approach towards reliability awareness, we propose a pre-emptive route toward wearout mitigation. Given the significant thermal and stress variation across the components of microprocessors, in this work we focus on one of the most likely candidates for overheating and hence reliability failures, the register file.

Unlike convolutions which are inherently parallel, the de-facto standard for NMS, namely GreedyNMS, cannot be easily parallelized and thus could be the performance bottleneck in convolutional object detection pipelines. MaxpoolNMS is introduced as a parallelizable alternative to GreedyNMS, which in turn enables faster speed than GreedyNMS at comparable accuracy. However, MaxpoolNMS is only capable of replacing the GreedyNMS at the first stage of two-stage detectors like Faster-RCNN. There is a significant drop in accuracy when applying MaxpoolNMS at the final detection stage, due to the fact that MaxpoolNMS fails to approximate GreedyNMS precisely in terms of bounding box selection. In this paper, we propose a general, parallelizable and configurable approach PSRR-MaxpoolNMS, to completely replace GreedyNMS at all stages in all detectors. By introducing a simple Relationship Recovery module and a Pyramid Shifted MaxpoolNMS module, our PSRR-MaxpoolNMS is able to approximate GreedyNMS more precisely than MaxpoolNMS. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach outperforms MaxpoolNMS by a large margin, and it is proven faster than GreedyNMS with comparable accuracy.

Energy efficiency is of paramount importance for WBSNs, because it allows a higher wearability (by requiring a smaller battery) and/or an increased mean time between charges. In this paper, we investigate how noise-aware design choices can be made to minimize energy consumption in WBSNs. Noise is unavoidable in biosignals acquisitions, either due to external factors (in case of ECGs, muscle contractions and respiration of subjects [2]) or to the design of the front-end analog acquisition block. From this observation stems the opportunity to apply inexact strategies such as on-node lossy compression to minimize the bandwidth over the energy-hungry wireless link [3], as long as the output quality of the signal, when reconstructed on the receiver side, is not constrained by the performed compression. To maximize gains, ultra-low-power platforms must be employed to perform the above-mentioned Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques.

Most of prior works use equal bit width to quantize all layers or channels, which is sub-optimal. On the other hand, it is very challenging to explore the hyperparameter space of channel bit widths, as the search space increases exponentially as the number of channels, which could be tens of thousand in a deep neural network. In this paper, we address an important problem of efficiently exploring the hyperparameter space of channel bit widths. We formulate the quantization of deep neural networks as a rate-distortion optimization problem, and present an ultra-fast algorithm to search the bit allocation of channels. Our approach has only linear time complexity and can find the optimal bit allocation within a few minutes on CPU. In addition, we provide an effective way to improve the performance on target hardware platforms. We restrict the bit rate (size) of each layer to allow as many weights and activations as possible to be stored on-chip, and incorporate hardware-aware constraints into our objective function. The hardware-aware constraints do not cause additional overhead to optimization, and have very positive impact on hardware performance. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art quantization results on four deep neural networks, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and MobileNet-v2, on ImageNet.

However, when it comes to 2 bits, the performance drop is still noticeable. One problem in these methods is that they assign equal bit rate to quantize weights and activations in all layers, which is not reasonable in the case of high rate compression (such as 2-bit quantization), as some of layers in deep neural networks are sensitive to quantization and performing coarse quantization on these layers can hurt the accuracy. In this paper, we address an important problem of how to optimize the bit allocation of weights and activations for deep CNNs compression. We first explore the additivity of output error caused by quantization and find that additivity property holds for deep neural networks which are continuously differentiable in the layers. Based on this observation, we formulate the optimal bit allocation problem of weights and activations in a joint framework and propose a very efficient method to solve the optimization problem via Lagrangian Formulation.

Further development of such devices and their translation to commercial applications depend largely on the availability of tools and methodologies that can enable the \u201ctemperature-aware\u201d design of liquid-cooled microprocessors and 2D/3D multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs). Recently, two optimal design methods have been proposed for liquid-cooled microchannel ICs: one to minimize on-chip temperature gradients and the other, called GreenCool, to maximize energy efficiency in the coolant pumping effort.

NVMs naturally enable techniques such as crash consistency; persistent snapshots, logs, and heaps; security-enhanced memories; and even near-or in-memory processing. However, all current NVM technologies suffer from limited write endurance. Monolithic 3D integration (M3D), an NVM-enabled, near-memory technique, drastically increases compute-to-memory connectivity, improving the energy-delay product (EDP), especially for dataintensive workloads. However, M3D systems have another constraint: scaling M3D memory capacity adds multiple compute-plusmemory chips in a NUMA arrangement. In response, we first develop a lifetime extension mechanism for endurance-limited memories (ELMs) that extends chip lifetime from mere minutes to several years. Our page-based scheme minimizes execution disruption. Second, we extend our single-chip scheme to multiple M3D chips. We show that NUMA policies for DRAM systems are ill-suited for M3D because they either incur too many costly off-chip accesses or sacrifice lifetime. Our technique preserves NUMA locality benefits while significantly improving overall system lifetime. For homogeneous multi-threaded workloads running across multiple NUMA nodes (chips), our multi-chip scheme increases lifetime over our single-chip scheme by a geometric mean of 48%. For a heterogeneous mixture of workloads running on a multi-monolithic-chip cluster, we increase cluster lifetime by a factor of 4.7\u00d7, bounded by a 6% energy and 6% runtime overhead (commonly with no runtime overhead at all)."}, {"title": "Session details: Reliable system design", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eCo7XWkAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=eCo7XWkAAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC", "authors": ["Mohamed Sabry Aly", "Semeen Rehman"], "description": "Session details: Reliable system design | Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Design, Automation & Test in Europe ACM Digital Library home ACM home Google, Inc.

Interestingly, we found that the proximal operator for the data term leads to a strongly convex optimization problem and therefore should have a unique optimal solution. However, CG in practice struggles to find it. This is quite well known in the tomography community (which is why SART and other methods remain popular for this application). For example the figure 1 shows results for comparing different solvers for the proximal operator. We can see that in all settings all methods seem to converge against a similar result (albeit at different speeds), except for CG (grey), which stalls at a much lower value. Note that this behavior is observed across different implementations of CG and CGLS. For example in our submission we use the CG implementation from RTK [1](as well as the projection/backprojection implementation from the same source), in the figure we show results from the ASTRA toolkit [2], and we also have results from our own CG implementation. So the issue for CG is quite reasonable.
