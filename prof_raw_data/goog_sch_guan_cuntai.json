Recent advances in brain activity recording tools and machine learning technologies have intrigued research and development of neurocomputing techniques for objective and neurophysiology-based pain detection. This paper proposes a pain detection framework based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The feasibility of CNN is investigated for distinguishing induced pain state from resting state in the recruitment of 10 chronic back pain patients. The experimental study recorded EEG signals in two phases: 1. movement stimulation (MS), where induces back pain by executing predefined movement tasks; 2. video stimulation (VS), where induces back pain perception by watching a \u2026", "total_citations": 13, "citation_graph": {"2022": 5, "2023": 7}}, {"title": "Three-class motor imagery classification based on fbcsp combined with voting mechanism", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=sg4vxPoAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=sg4vxPoAAAAJ:U6twwk6Vgq8C", "authors": ["Bo Li", "Banghua Yang", "Cuntai Guan", "Chenxiao Hu"], "publication_date": "2019/6/14", "conference": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Virtual Environments for Measurement Systems and Applications (CIVEMSA)", "description": "Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is an effective algorithm in constructing optimal spatial filters, which is widely used to discriminate two classes of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal in Motor Imagery (MI) based Brain Computer Interface (BCI).

Though numerous research groups and institutes collect a multitude of EEG datasets for the same BCI task, sharing EEG data from multiple sites is still challenging due to the heterogeneity of devices. The significance of this challenge cannot be overstated, given the critical role of data diversity in fostering model robustness. However, existing works rarely discuss this issue, predominantly centering their attention on model training within a single dataset, often in the context of inter-subject or inter-session settings. In this work, we propose a hierarchical personalized Federated Learning EEG decoding (FLEEG) framework to surmount this challenge. This innovative framework heralds a new learning paradigm for BCI, enabling datasets with disparate data formats to collaborate in the model training process. Each client is assigned a specific dataset and trains a hierarchical personalized model to manage diverse data formats and facilitate information exchange. Meanwhile, the server coordinates the training procedure to harness knowledge gleaned from all datasets, thus elevating overall performance. The framework has been evaluated in Motor Imagery (MI) classification with nine EEG datasets collected by different devices but implementing the same MI task. Results demonstrate that the proposed frame can boost classification performance up to 16.7% by enabling knowledge sharing between multiple datasets, especially for smaller datasets.

In this study, we propose to process the 3D data by a 2+1D framework so that we can exploit the powerful deep 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) networks pre-trained on the huge ImageNet dataset for 3D neuroimaging recognition. Specifically, 3D volumes of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) metrics (grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid) are decomposed to 2D slices according to neighboring voxel positions and inputted to 2D CNN models pre-trained on the ImageNet to extract feature maps from three views (axial, coronal, and sagittal). Global pooling is applied to remove redundant information as the activation patterns are sparsely distributed over feature maps. Channel-wise and slice-wise convolutions are proposed to aggregate the contextual information in the third view dimension unprocessed by the 2D CNN model. Multi-metric and multi-view information are fused for final prediction.

However, due to the volume conduction effect, EEG data suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and poor spatial resolution. Thus, it is hard to effectively identify the task-related connectivity pattern at the scalp-level using unsupervised method. There exist extensive discriminative spatial filtering methods for different BCI paradigms. However, in conventional spatial filter optimization methods, signal correlations or connectivities are not taken into consideration in the objective functions. To address the issue, in this work, we propose a discriminative connectivity pattern-learning method.
