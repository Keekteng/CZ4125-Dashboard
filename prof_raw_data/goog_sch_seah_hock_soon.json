In this technique, a phase-shifting algorithm is used to calculate the wrapped phase, and a set of Gray-code binary patterns is used to determine the unwrapped phase. In the real measurement, the captured Gray-code patterns are no longer binary, resulting in phase unwrapping errors at a large number of erroneous pixels. Although this problem has been attended and well resolved by a few methods, it remains challenging when a measured object has step-heights and the captured patterns contain invalid pixels. To effectively remove unwrapping errors and simultaneously preserve step-heights, in this paper, an effective method using an adaptive median filter is proposed. Both simulations and experiments can demonstrate its effectiveness.", "total_citations": 147, "citation_graph": {"2017": 5, "2018": 13, "2019": 18, "2020": 33, "2021": 24, "2022": 28, "2023": 25}}, {"title": "Complex object correspondence construction in two-dimensional animation", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=6QTmlnAAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=6QTmlnAAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "authors": ["Jun Yu", "Dongquan Liu", "Dacheng Tao", "Hock Soon Seah"], "publication_date": "2011/5/31", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "description": "Correspondence construction of objects in key frames is the precondition for inbetweening and coloring in 2-D computer-assisted animation production. Since each frame of an animation consists of multiple layers, objects are complex in terms of shape and structure. Therefore, existing shape-matching algorithms specifically designed for simple structures such as a single closed contour cannot perform well on objects constructed by multiple contours with an open shape. This paper introduces a semisupervised patch alignment framework for complex object correspondence construction. In particular, the new framework constructs local patches for each point on an object and aligns these patches in a new feature space, in which correspondences between objects can be detected by the subsequent clustering.

Both questions are important for animators and cartoon enthusiasts to design and create new cartoons by utilizing existing cartoon materials. The first key issue to answer those questions is to find a proper representation that describes the cartoon character effectively. In this paper, we consider multiple features from different views, i.e., color histogram, Hausdorff edge feature, and skeleton feature, to represent cartoon characters with different colors, shapes, and gestures. Each visual feature reflects a unique characteristic of a cartoon character, and they are complementary to each other for retrieval and synthesis. However, how to combine the three visual features is the second key issue of our application.

It smoothes a fringe pattern along directions both parallel and perpendicular to fringe orientation with suitable diffusion speeds to more effectively reduce noise and improve fringe-pattern quality. It is a generalized work of Tang's et al.'s [Opt. Lett.33, 2179 (2008)] model that only smoothes a fringe pattern along fringe orientation.
