learning has shown promising improvements on various vision-language tasks. Most existing methods employ a transformer-based multimodal encoder to jointly model visual tokens (region-based image features) and word tokens. Because the visual tokens and word tokens are unaligned, it is challenging for the multimodal encoder to learn image-text interactions. In this paper, we introduce a contrastive loss to ALign the image and text representations BEfore Fusing (ALBEF) them through cross-modal attention, which enables more grounded vision and language representation learning. Unlike most existing methods, our method does not require bounding box annotations nor high-resolution images. In order to improve learning from noisy web data, we propose momentum distillation, a self-training method which learns from pseudo-targets produced by a momentum model. We provide a theoretical analysis of ALBEF from a mutual information maximization perspective, showing that different training tasks can be interpreted as different ways to generate views for an image-text pair. ALBEF achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream vision-language tasks. On image-text retrieval, ALBEF outperforms methods that are pre-trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. On VQA and NLVR , ALBEF achieves absolute improvements of 2.37% and 3.84% compared to the state-of-the-art, while enjoying faster inference speed.

With the recent advances in deep learning, in particular distributed representation of words (a.k.a. word embeddings), we present a novel ER system, called DeepER, that achieves good accuracy, high efficiency, as well as ease-of-use (i.e., much less human efforts). For accuracy, we use sophisticated composition methods, namely uni- and bi-directional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short term memory (LSTM) hidden units, to convert each tuple to a distributed representation (i.e., a vector), which can in turn be used to effectively capture similarities between tuples. We consider both the case where pre-trained word embeddings are available as well the case where they are not; we present ways to learn and tune the distributed representations. For efficiency, we propose a locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based blocking approach that uses distributed representations of tuples; it takes all attributes of a tuple into consideration and produces much smaller blocks, compared with traditional methods that consider only a few attributes. For ease-of-use, DeepER requires much less human labeled data and does not need feature engineering, compared with traditional machine learning based approaches which require handcrafted features, and similarity functions along with their associated thresholds.

We propose GeDi as an efficient method for using smaller LMs as generative discriminators to guide generation from large LMs to make them safer and more controllable. GeDi guides generation at each step by computing classification probabilities for all possible next tokens via Bayes rule by normalizing over two class-conditional distributions; one conditioned on the desired attribute, or control code, and another conditioned on the undesired attribute, or anti control code. We find that GeDi gives stronger controllability than the state of the art method while also achieving generation speeds more than 30 times faster. Additionally, training GeDi on only four topics allows us to controllably generate new topics zero-shot from just a keyword, unlocking a new capability that previous controllable generation methods do not have. Lastly, we show that GeDi can make GPT-2 (1.5B parameters) significantly less toxic without sacrificing linguistic quality, making it by far the most practical existing method for detoxifying large language models while maintaining a fast generation speed.", "total_citations": 223, "citation_graph": {"2020": 6, "2021": 35, "2022": 98, "2023": 84}}, {"title": "Codra: A novel discriminative framework for rhetorical analysis", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=hR249csAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=hR249csAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "authors": ["Shafiq Joty", "Giuseppe Carenini", "Raymond T Ng"], "publication_date": "2015/9/1", "journal": "Computational Linguistics", "description": "Clauses and sentences rarely stand on their own in an actual discourse; rather, the relationship between them carries important information that allows the discourse to express a meaning as a whole beyond the sum of its individual parts.

Our framework called LFPT5 takes full advantage of PT's strong few-shot learning ability, and simultaneously trains the model as a task solver and a data generator. Before learning a new domain of the same task type, LFPT5 generates pseudo (labeled) samples of previously learned domains, and later gets trained on those samples to alleviate forgetting of previous knowledge as it learns the new domain. In addition, a KL divergence loss is minimized to achieve label consistency between the previous and the current model. While adapting to a new task type, LFPT5 includes and tunes additional prompt embeddings for the new task.

The retrofitted model tracks the representation vector of a vertex over time, facilitating vertex-based temporal analysis of a network.

While previous studies mainly focus on how to model the flow and alignment of the conversation, there has been no thorough study to date on which parts of the context and history are necessary for the model. We argue that shortening the context and history is crucial as it can help the model to optimise more on the conversational alignment property. To this end, we propose CoHS-CQG, a two-stage CQG framework, which adopts a CoHS module to shorten the context and history of the input. In particular, CoHS selects contiguous sentences and history turns according to their relevance scores by a top-p strategy.

For feature adaptation, we employ a speaker-aware persistent memory model which generalizes better to unseen test speakers by making use of speaker i-vectors to form a persistent memory. For model adaptation, we use a novel gradual pruning method to adapt to target speakers without changing the model architecture, which to the best of our knowledge, has never been explored in ASR. Specifically, we gradually prune less contributing parameters on model encoder to a certain sparsity level, and use the pruned parameters for adaptation, while freezing the unpruned parameters to keep the original model performance.

The task is generally cast into two different settings: answer-aware and answer-unaware. While the former facilitates the models by exposing the expected answer, the latter is more realistic and receiving growing attentions recently. What-to-ask and how-to-ask are the two main challenges in the answer-unaware setting. To address the first challenge, existing methods mainly select sequential sentences in context as the rationales. We argue that the conversation generated using such naive heuristics may not be natural enough as in reality, the interlocutors often talk about the relevant contents that are not necessarily sequential in context. Additionally, previous methods decide the type of question to be generated (boolean/span-based) implicitly. Modeling the question type explicitly is crucial as the answer, which hints the models to generate a boolean or span-based question, is unavailable. To this end, we present SG-CQG, a two-stage CQG framework. For the what-to-ask stage, a sentence is selected as the rationale from a semantic graph that we construct, and extract the answer span from it. For the how-to-ask stage, a classifier determines the target answer type of the question via two explicit control signals before generating and filtering. In addition, we propose Conv-Distinct, a novel evaluation metric for CQG, to evaluate the diversity of the generated conversation from a context.

To elicit LLMs' ability onto low-resource languages without any supervised data, we propose to assemble synthetic exemplars from a diverse set of high-resource languages to prompt the LLMs to translate from any language into English.

While conventional search-based techniques typically rely on heuristic rules or a redundancy assumption to mine fix patterns, recent years have witnessed the surge of deep learning (DL) based approaches to automate the program repair process in a data-driven manner. However, their performance is often limited by a fixed set of parameters to model the highly complex search space of APR. To ease such burden on the parametric models, in this work, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Patch Generation framework (RAP-Gen) by explicitly leveraging relevant fix patterns retrieved from a codebase of previous bug-fix pairs. Specifically, we build a hybrid patch retriever to account for both lexical and semantic matching based on the raw source code in a language-agnostic manner, which does not rely on any code-specific features. In addition, we adapt a code-aware language model CodeT5 as our foundation model to facilitate both patch retrieval and generation tasks in a unified manner. We adopt a stage-wise approach where the patch retriever first retrieves a relevant external bug-fix pair to augment the buggy input for the CodeT5 patch generator, which synthesizes a ranked list of repair patch candidates. Notably, RAP-Gen is a generic APR framework that can flexibly integrate different patch retrievers and generators to repair various types of bugs.

Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on several popular few-shot benchmarks as well as a strong level of controllability through entities, all while only tuning several orders of magnitude less parameters."}, {"title": "Randomized Smoothing with Masked Inference for Adversarially Robust NLP Systems", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=hR249csAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=hR249csAAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC", "authors": ["Han Cheol Moon", "Shafiq Joty", "Ruochen Zhao", "Megh Thakkar", "Xu Chi"], "publication_date": "2022/9/29", "description": "Large-scale pre-trained language models have shown outstanding performance in a variety of NLP tasks. However, they are also known to be significantly brittle against specifically crafted adversarial examples, leading to increasing interest in probing the adversarial robustness of NLP systems. We introduce RSMI, a novel two-stage framework that combines randomized smoothing (RS) with masked inference (MI) to improve the adversarial robustness of NLP systems. RS transforms a classifier into a smoothed classifier to obtain robust representations, whereas MI forces a model to exploit the surrounding context of a masked token in an input sequence. RSMI improves adversarial robustness by 2 to 3 times over existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. We also perform in-depth qualitative analysis to validate the effectiveness of the different stages of RSMI and probe the impact of its components through extensive ablations. By empirically proving the stability of RSMI, we put it forward as a practical method to robustly train large-scale NLP models.

Stemmed from the compositional nature of languages, spurious correlations have further undermined the trustworthiness of NLP systems. Thus, there exists an urgent demand for causal explanations to encourage fairness and transparency. To derive more causal, usable, and faithful explanations, we propose a complete framework for interpreting language models by deriving causal concepts. Specifically, we propose a post-hoc method that derives both high-level concepts and surface-level local explanations from hidden layer activations. To ensure causality, we optimize for a causal loss that maximizes the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), where we intervene on the concept-level as an innovative substitute to the traditional counterfactual interventions. Moreover, we devise several causality evaluation metrics for explanations that can be universally applied. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior results on causality, usability, and faithfulness compared to the baselines.

As real input noise is difficult to predict during training, robustness is a big issue for system deployment. In this paper, we improve the robustness of NMT models by reducing the effect of noisy words through a Context-Enhanced Reconstruction (CER) approach. CER trains the model to resist noise in two steps: (1) perturbation step that breaks the naturalness of input sequence with made-up words; (2) reconstruction step that defends the noise propagation by generating better and more robust contextual representation. Experimental results on Chinese-English (ZH-EN) and French-English (FR-EN) translation tasks demonstrate robustness improvement on both news and social media text.

It addresses a particular topic, often covering multiple subtopics, and is organized in a coherent way that enables the reader to process the information. Discourse analysis seeks to uncover such underlying structures, which can support many applications including text summarization and information extraction. This thesis focuses on building novel computational models of different discourse analysis tasks in asynchronous conversations; ie, conversations where participants communicate with each other at different times (eg, emails, blogs). Effective processing of these conversations can be of great strategic value for both organizations and individuals. We propose novel computational models for topic segmentation and labeling, rhetorical parsing and dialog act recognition in asynchronous conversation. Our approaches rely on two related computational methodologies: graph theory and probabilistic graphical models. The topic segmentation and labeling models find the high-level discourse structure; ie, the global topical structure of an asynchronous conversation. Our graph-based approach extends state-of-the-art methods by integrating a fine-grained conversational structure with other conversational features. On the other hand, the rhetorical parser captures the coherence structure, a finer discourse structure, by identifying coherence relations between the discourse units within each comment of the conversation.

Recent advancements have extended their capabilities to handle long-input contexts, surpassing token limits of 32k or more. However, in the realm of multi-document question answering, language models exhibit uneven utilization of their input context. They tend to favor the initial and final segments, resulting in a U-shaped performance pattern concerning where the answer is located within the input. This bias raises concerns, particularly in summarization tasks where crucial content may be dispersed throughout the source document (s). This paper presents a comprehensive investigation encompassing 10 datasets, 4 LLMs, and 5 evaluation metrics to analyze how these models leverage their input for abstractive summarization.
