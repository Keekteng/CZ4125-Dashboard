Due to its pose oblivious property, SDF is widely used in shape analysis, segmentation and retrieval. However, computing SDF is computationally expensive since one has to place an inverted cone at each point and then average the penetration distances for a number of rays inside the cone. Furthermore, the shape diameters are highly sensitive to local geometric features as well as the normal vectors, hence diminishing their applications to real-world meshes which often contain rich geometric details and/or various types of defects, such as noise and gaps. In order to increase the robustness of SDF and promote it to a wide range of 3D models, we define SDF by offsetting the input object a little bit. This seemingly minor change brings three significant benefits: First, it allows us to compute SDF in a robust manner since the offset surface is able to give reliable normal vectors. Second, it runs many times faster since at each point we only need to compute the penetration distance along a single direction, rather than tens of directions. Third, our method does not require watertight surfaces as the input\u2014it supports both point clouds and meshes with noise and gaps. Extensive experimental results show that the offset-surface based SDF is robust to noise and insensitive to geometric details, and it also runs about 10 times faster than the existing method.

In high noise conditions, they iterate the filtering process. However, this iterative filtering is only done at test time and is less effective at ensuring points converge quickly onto the clean surfaces. We propose IterativePFN (iterative point cloud filtering network), which consists of multiple IterationModules that model the true iterative filtering process internally, within a single network.

To be specific, ParaNet converts an irregular 3D point cloud into a regular 2D color image, named point geometry image (PGI), where each pixel encodes the spatial coordinates of a point. In contrast to conventional regular representation modalities based on multi-view projection and voxelization, the proposed representation is differentiable and reversible. Technically, ParaNet is composed of a surface embedding module, which parameterizes 3D surface points onto a unit square, and a grid resampling module, which resamples the embedded 2D manifold over regular dense grids. Note that ParaNet is unsupervised, i.e., the training simply relies on reference-free geometry constraints. The PGIs can be seamlessly coupled with a task network established upon standard and mature techniques for 2D images/videos to realize a specific task for 3D point clouds.

Additionally, the pre-trained template serves a good initialization for our model to adapt to unseen individuals."}, {"title": "Robust Zero Level-Set Extraction from Unsigned Distance Fields Based on Double Covering", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ISNmBxwAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=ISNmBxwAAAAJ:ijdKiLOsEJMC", "authors": ["FEI HOU", "XUHUI CHEN", "WENCHENG WANG", "HONG QIN", "YING HE"], "publication_date": "2023", "description": "Fig. 1. DoubleCoverUDF is a robust method for extracting the zero level-set from unsigned distance fields, enabling the representation of both open and closed 3D surfaces. Comparison with MeshUDF [Guillard et al. 2022] and MeshCAP [Zhou et al. 2022] on the open models from the Deep Fashion3D dataset [Zhu et al. 2020] shows that the extracted meshes using DoubleCoverUDF exhibit several favorable characteristics, such as the absence of non-manifold vertices, visually appealing results, and the ability to accurately capture the correct topological features of the target surfaces. Here, \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc63, \ud835\udc4f, and \ud835\udc54 denote the percentage of non-manifold vertices, the number of boundaries, and the genus of the meshes, respectively. Additionally, we compute the Chamfer distance (CD) between the extracted meshes and the given point clouds to assess their geometric accuracy. A marching cubes resolution of 2563 is used in these examples.\nIn this paper, we propose a new method, called DoubleCoverUDF, for extracting the zero level-set from unsigned distance fields (UDFs). DoubleCoverUDF takes a learned UDF and a user-specified parameter \ud835\udc5f (a small positive real number) as input and extracts an iso-surface with an iso-value \ud835\udc5f using the conventional marching cubes algorithm. We show that the computed isosurface is the boundary of the \ud835\udc5f-offset volume of the target zero level-set \ud835\udc46,"}, {"title": "Masonry shell structures with discrete equivalence classes", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ISNmBxwAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=ISNmBxwAAAAJ:dAp6zn-oMfAC", "authors": ["Rulin Chen", "Pengyun Qiu", "Peng Song", "Bailin Deng", "Ziqi Wang", "Ying He"], "publication_date": "2023", "journal": "ACM Transactions on Graphics", "description": "This paper proposes a method to model masonry shell structures where the shell elements fall into a set of discrete equivalence classes. Such shell structure can reduce the fabrication cost and simplify the physical construction due to reuse of a few template shell elements. Given a freeform surface, our goal is to generate a small set of template shell elements that can be reused to produce a seamless and buildable structure that closely resembles the surface. The major technical challenge in this process is balancing the desire for high reusability of template elements with the need for a seamless and buildable final structure. To address the challenge, we define three error metrics to measure the seamlessness and buildability of shell structures made from discrete equivalence classes and develop a hierarchical cluster-and-optimize approach to generate a small set of template elements that produce a structure closely approximating the surface with low error metrics. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on various freeform surfaces and geometric patterns, and validate buildability of our results with four physical prototypes.

We show that manifold splines afford a general theoretical and computational framework for modeling geometrically complicated surfaces of arbitrary topology. The technical challenge is how to extend polynomial-centric splines defined over open, planar domains to that over any manifold setting. Our solution is an affine structure for any manifold surface, serving as a parametric domain, so that piecewise spline functions can be naturally and elegantly blended to represent geometric shapes of arbitrary topology. Built upon our prior efforts, the primary foci are to broaden and strengthen the theoretical foundation as well as to devise practical algorithms for manifold splines. In particular, we advocate several novel mathematical tools to compute affine atlas for any domain manifold.

The existing computer-generated lines, such as suggestive contours, apparent ridges, and demarcating curves, adopt the two-pass framework: in the first pass, certain geometric features or properties are extracted or computed in the object space; then in the second pass, the line drawings are rendered by iterating each polygonal face or edge. It is known these approaches are very sensitive to the mesh quality, and usually require appropriate preprocessing operations (e.g. smoothing, remeshing, etc.) to the input meshes. This paper presents a simple yet robust approach to generate view-dependent line drawings for 3D models. Inspired by the image edge detector, we compute the difference-of-Gaussian of illumination on the 3D model. With moderate assumption, we show all the expensive computations can be done in the pre-computing stage. Our method naturally integrates object- and image-spaces in that we compute the geometric features in the object space and then adopt a simple fragment shader to render the lines in the image space. As a result, our algorithm is more efficient than the existing object-space approaches, since the lines are generated in a single pass without iterating the mesh edges/faces. Furthermore, our method is more flexible and robust than the existing algorithms in that it does not require the preprocessing on the input 3D models. Finally, the difference-of-Gaussian operator can be extended to the anisotropic setting guided by local geometric features.
