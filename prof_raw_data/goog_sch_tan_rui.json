The shifts can be caused by sensor characteristic variations and/or discrepancies between the design-phase model and the actual model of the sensed physical process. To address these issues, existing transfer learning techniques require substantial target-domain data and thus incur high post-deployment overhead. This paper proposes to exploit the first principle governing the domain shift to reduce the demand on target-domain data. Specifically, our proposed approach called PhyAug uses the first principle fitted with few labeled or unlabeled source/target-domain data pairs to transform the existing source-domain training data into augmented data for updating the deep neural networks.

However, many existing fusion schemes do not consider the quality of each fusion input and may suffer from adverse conditions on one or more sensors. While predictive uncertainty has been applied to characterize single-modal object detection performance at run time, incorporating uncertainties into the multi-modal fusion still lacks effective solutions due primarily to the uncertainty's cross-modal incomparability and distinct sensitivities to various adverse conditions. To fill this gap, this paper proposes Uncertainty-Encoded Mixture-of-Experts (UMoE) that explicitly incorporates single-modal uncertainties into LiDAR-camera fusion. UMoE uses individual expert network to process each sensor's detection result together with encoded uncertainty. Then, the expert networks' outputs are analyzed by a gating network to determine the fusion weights. The proposed UMoE module can be integrated into any proposal fusion pipeline. Evaluation shows that UMoE achieves a maximum of 10.67%, 3.17%, and 5.40% performance gain compared with the state-of-the-art proposal-level multi-modal object detectors under extreme weather, adversarial, and blinding attack scenarios."}, {"title": "Susceptibility of Autonomous Driving Agents to Learning-Based Action-Space Attacks", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=co5MGPkAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=co5MGPkAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "authors": ["Yuting Wu", "Xin Lou", "Pengfei Zhou", "Rui Tan", "Zbigniew T Kalbarczyk", "Ravishankar K Iyer"], "publication_date": "2023/6/27", "conference": "2023 53rd Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN-W)", "description": "Intelligent vehicles with increasing complexity face cybersecurity threats.

In particular, the testbed is equipped with cooling, heating, and ventilation systems that are under our full control. Thus, we can operate the testbed in a wide range of server room conditions. The test rooms and servers are instrumented with hardware and software sensors monitoring more than 200 measurement points. An extensive test plan is being executed to collect a large volume of data to understand the impact of environmental conditions on server's computing performance and reliability as well as the energy efficiency of the testbed. The results will provide important guidelines for building and operating energy-efficient data centers.

As a fundamental performance measure of WSNs, coverage characterizes how well a sensing field is monitored by a network. Two facets of coverage, i.e., spatial coverage and temporal coverage, quantify the percentage of area that is well monitored by the network and the timeliness of the network in detecting targets appearing in the sensing field, respectively. Although advanced collaborative signal processing algorithms have been adopted by many existing WSNs, most previous analytical studies on spatiotemporal coverage of WSNs are conducted based on overly simplistic sensing models (e.g., the disc model) that do not capture the stochastic nature of sensing. In this chapter, we attempt to bridge this gap by exploring the fundamental limits of spatiotemporal coverage based on \u2026"}, {"title": "Energy-Saving Strategies in the Air-Cooled Tropical Data Center with Thermoeconomic Assessments", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=co5MGPkAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=co5MGPkAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "authors": ["Fei Duan", "Jing Zhou", "Baris Burak Kanbur", "Duc Van Le", "Rui Tan"], "journal": "Available at SSRN 4462996", "description": "Rapid developments of the electronic information industry promote energy usages of cooling system in data centers to be paid extensive attention, especially in the tropical environment.
