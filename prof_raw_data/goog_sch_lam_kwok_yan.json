On the other hand, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely adopted by digital service providers to improve operational productivity and customer satisfaction. ML inevitably accesses and processes users' personal data, which could potentially breach the relevant privacy protection regulations if not performed carefully. The situation is exacerbated by the cloud-based implementation of digital services when user data are captured and stored in distributed locations, hence aggregation of the user data for ML could be a serious breach of privacy regulations. In this backdrop, Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging area that allows ML on distributed data without the data leaving their stored location. However, depending on the nature of the digital services, data captured at different locations may carry different significance to the business operation, hence a weighted aggregation will be highly desirable for enhancing the quality of the FL-learned model. Furthermore, to prevent leakage of user data from the aggregated gradients, cryptographic mechanisms are needed to allow secure aggregation of FL.

One of the main differences between our scheme and existing schemes is that we utilize visual identifier, i.e., profile image which is common in OSN, as the public key.

It is more intuitive and much easier to understand human behaviors with less redundancy in concept by exploring the behavior interior dimensions, compared with directly using behavior exteriors. However, they usually approach from a unidimensional perspective with a lack of a sense of interrelatedness. Thus, integrating multiple behavior dimensions together into some numerical measures to form a more comprehensive view for subsequent prediction processes becomes a pivotal issue.

This paper conducts a comparative study of both approaches in predicting information diffusion with three mechanisms: retweet cascade, url cascade, and hashtag cascade. Experiments on Twitter data show that the semantic model outperforms the transactional model, if the exterior pattern is less directly observable (ie hashtag cascade). When it becomes more directly observable (ie retweet and url cascades), the semantic method yet delivers approximate accuracy (ie url cascade) or even worse accuracy (ie retweet cascade).

The cyberspace has evolved from a hardware internetworking infrastructure to the notion of a virtual environment, transforming how people, business and government interact and operate. Through this transformation, lots of personal data are captured which individuals have no ownership or control over, threatening their privacy. It is therefore necessary for the data owners to have control over the ownership, custody and utilization of their data and to protect one's digital assets and identity through proper data governance, cybersecurity control and privacy protection. This results in the notions of data sovereignty and digital sovereignty - two conceptually related terms, but different focuses. This paper first explains these two concepts in terms of their guiding principles, laws and regulations requirements, and analyse and discuss the technical challenges of implementing these requirements. Next, to understand the emerging trend shift in digital sovereignty towards individuals to take complete control of the security and privacy of their own digital assets, this paper conducts a systematic study and analysis of Self-Sovereign Identity, and discuss existing solutions and point out that an efficient key management system, scalability and interoperability of the solutions and well established standards are some of its challenges and \u2026", "total_citations": 6, "citation_graph": {"2022": 5, "2023": 1}}, {"title": "Agent-Based Spectrum Management Scheme in Satellite Communication Systems", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NDMIYKsAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=NDMIYKsAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC", "authors": ["Feng Li", "Kwok-Yan Lam", "Zhengguo Sheng", "Weidang Lu", "Xin Liu", "Li Wang"], "publication_date": "2021/2/16", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "description": "Efficient spectrum management has always been an important issue due to the scarcity of satellite spectral resource, especially with the ever-increasing broadband demand.

For example, 6G networks are capable of providing high-speed network access by exploiting higher frequency spectrum; high-throughout satellite communication services are also adopted to achieve pervasive coverage in remote and isolated areas. In order to enable seamless access, Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Communication Networks (ISTCN) has emerged as an important research area. ISTCN aims to provide high speed and pervasive network services by integrating broadband terrestrial mobile networks with satellite communication networks. As terrestrial mobile networks began to use higher frequency spectrum (between 3GHz to 40GHz) which overlaps with that of satellite communication (4GHz to 8GHz for C band and 26GHz to 40GHz for Ka band), there are opportunities and challenges. On one hand, satellite terminals can potentially access terrestrial networks in an integrated manner; on the other hand, there will be more congestion and interference in this spectrum, hence more efficient spectrum management techniques are required. In this paper, we propose a new technique to improve spectrum sharing performance by introducing Non-orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (NOMA) and Cognitive Radio (CR) in the spectrum sharing of ISTCN.

In this paper, we propose an approach for constructing efficient -party protocols for secure neural network training that can provide security for all honest participants even when a majority of the parties are malicious. Compared to the other designs that provide semi-honest security in a dishonest majority setting, our actively secure neural network training incurs affordable efficiency overheads of around 2X and 2.7X in LAN and WAN settings, respectively.
