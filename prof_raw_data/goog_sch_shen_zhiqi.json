However, in this paper we argue that random input weight selection may lead to an ill-conditioned problem, for which solutions will be numerically unstable. In order to improve the conditioning of ELM, we propose an input weight selection algorithm for an ELM with linear hidden neurons. Experiment results show that by applying the proposed algorithm accuracy is maintained while condition is perfectly stable.", "total_citations": 72, "citation_graph": {"2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 11, "2017": 3, "2018": 14, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}, {"title": "Design of fuzzy cognitive maps using neural networks for predicting chaotic time series", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=EA2T_lwAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=EA2T_lwAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "authors": ["HJ Song", "CY Miao", "ZQ Shen", "W Roel", "DH Maja", "C Francky"], "publication_date": "2010/12/31", "journal": "Neural Networks", "description": "As a powerful paradigm for knowledge representation and a simulation mechanism applicable to numerous research and application fields, Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) have attracted a great deal of attention from various research communities. However, the traditional FCMs do not provide efficient methods to determine the states of the investigated system and to quantify causalities which are the very foundation of the FCM theory. Therefore in many cases, constructing FCMs for complex causal systems greatly depends on expert knowledge. The manually developed models have a substantial shortcoming due to model subjectivity and difficulties with accessing its reliability. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy neural network to enhance the learning ability of FCMs so that the automatic determination of membership functions and quantification of causalities can be incorporated with the inference mechanism of \u2026", "total_citations": 69, "citation_graph": {"2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}, {"title": "A reputation-aware decision-making approach for improving the efficiency of crowdsourcing systems", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=EA2T_lwAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=EA2T_lwAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "authors": ["Han Yu", "Zhiqi Shen", "Chunyan Miao", "Bo An"], "publication_date": "2013/5/6", "book": "Proceedings of the 2013 international conference on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems", "description": "A crowdsourcing system is a useful platform for utilizing the intelligence and skills of the mass. Nevertheless, like any open system that involves the exchange of things of value, selfish and malicious behaviors exist in crowdsourcing systems and need to be mitigated. Trust management has been proven to be a viable solution in many systems. However, a major difference between crowdsourcing systems and existing trust models designed for multi-agent systems is that human trustees have limited task processing capacity per unit time compared to an intelligent agent program. This paper recognizes a problem in current trust-aware decision-making methods for task assignment in crowdsourcing platforms. On the one hand, trust-based methods over-assign tasks to trusted workers, while on the other hand, workload-based solutions do not give sufficient guarantees on the quality of work. The proposed solution, the social welfare optimizing reputation-aware decision-making (SWORD) approach, strikes a balance between the two and is shown through extensive simulations to significantly improve social welfare of crowdsourcing platforms compared to related work.", "total_citations": 68, "citation_graph": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 13, "2016": 21, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}]}
