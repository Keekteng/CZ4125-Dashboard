After being trained by TIE phase results, the dTIE retains the advantages of TIE, and overcomes the shortcomings of TIE as follows: (i) only one de-focus intensity image is required for phase imaging while the result is very close to the TIE result with SSIM index reaches 0.95, enabling more efficient phase imaging; (ii) the boundary problem automatically disappears due to the translation invariance of the convolutional \u2026", "total_citations": 38, "citation_graph": {"2020": 1, "2021": 11, "2022": 16, "2023": 10}}, {"title": "Toward real-time virtual biopsy of oral lesions using confocal laser endomicroscopy interfaced with embedded computing", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=JCehBDoAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=JCehBDoAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "authors": ["Patricia SP Thong", "Stephanus S Tandjung", "Muhammad Mobeen Movania", "Wei-Ming Chiew", "Malini Olivo", "Ramaswamy Bhuvaneswari", "Hock-Soon Seah", "Feng Lin", "Kemao Qian", "Khee-Chee Soo"], "publication_date": "2012/5/1", "journal": "Journal of biomedical optics", "description": "Oral lesions are conventionally diagnosed using white light endoscopy and histopathology.

With the help of 3D body scanner and neural networks, body measurement can be fast and accurate, thus reducing the cost. This paper introduces neural network models to predict body sizes and the measurements used to customize clothes from various body data. Three kinds of input data are used: raw 3D point clouds of human bodies, key body locations, and estimated body measurements. Raw point clouds are collected by scanning the participants' body, and key body locations and estimated measurements are automatically computed by existing software based on the point clouds.

These filters deliver high quality results since they process in the windowed Fourier domain which is more robust to noise than the spatial domain. However WFT is relatively slow because of convolution or Fourier transform needs to be executed for many times. In this paper, a revised version of WFT filters are proposed that reduces execution time yet offers almost the same result.

Our proposed algorithm is an even lighter-weight version of the recent state-of-the-art binary-based texture-less object detector BIND (Binary Integrated Net Descriptor), primarily customized for mobile device applications. This modification, termed BIND-Lite, employs various techniques to overcome the low-computational power of current mobile devices, while mostly retaining the texture-less object detection robustness of the original BIND. On current generation mobile devices, BIND-Lite was able to achieve runtime rates of up to 30 frames per second.

The adjoin list is an important part in quality guided phase unwrapping. Different implementations of the adjoin list will affect speed and possibly accuracy in the phase unwrapping process.

A good choice is to split it in to short linked lists, especially when the pixels are equally or near equally distributed in those linked lists. Otherwise, if the quality of pixels is concentrated in a small range, the speedup becomes less obvious. To solve this problem, a dynamic adjoin list is proposed.

The information to be measured is often related to the phase. The process of retrieving phase from a single fringe pattern is called fringe pattern demodulation. The demodulation process may fail due to the noise presented in the fringe pattern, and denoising becomes necessary.

First, a general local fringe model that includes a linear background, a linear modulation and a quadratic phase is adopted in the proposed enhanced cost function.

When traditional image processing methods, such as median filter, mean value filter or FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), are employed to reduce the speckle noise of an image pattern, some useful information will be lost while the noise being removed. For example, the board of the object in the pattern would become blur. The WTNFM, on the other hand, can reduce the loss of information when the speckle noise is removed from the fringe pattern because it can apply different filtering method to the different area of the fringe pattern. It can keep the board of the object in the fringe pattern clear after filtering speckle noise. The principle of the wavelet transform is introduced first, and then a practical algorithm to reduce the speckle noise of a fringe pattern is given \u2026"}, {"title": "HIGH EXPRESSION OF HUMAN-SPECIFIC MARKERS IN BNX MOUSE FOLLOWING INFUSION OF HUMAN CORD-BLOOD (CB) PROGENITORS", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=JCehBDoAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=JCehBDoAAAAJ:g9YHGIZn7mcC", "authors": ["A ABDELMAGEED", "C TURNER", "J LAVER", "A SALEH", "F XU", "S KOZA", "K QIAN", "Y HE"], "publication_date": "1994/11/15", "conference": "BLOOD"}, {"title": "\u5199\u8bd7\u4e0e\u5199paper", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=JCehBDoAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=JCehBDoAAAAJ:PQ6BjWB6CiEC"}, {"title": "Fringe Pattern Analysis: Some Results and Discussions (III)", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=JCehBDoAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=JCehBDoAAAAJ:6xXPb0EiZccC", "authors": ["Kemao Qian"], "description": "Fringe-based measurement techniques provide an accurate, straightforward and convenient means for optical metrology and experimental mechanics [1].

One of the intuitive and reliable methods is the structured light with binary codes. In this paper, we discuss some similar methods with higher resolution and accuracy: the two-frequency method, the phase coding method and the gray code method. All these methods use fringe projection as the basic technique, along with specific mechanisms to achieve absolute measurement, ie, without value ambiguity. Although these methods have been widely used, their performances compared with each other remain unclear, motivating us to carry out a theoretical and experimental study. This study elucidates their respective advantages and disadvantages in accuracy and speed. The theoretical models, simulation-based comparisons and real measurement results will be provided and discussed."}, {"title": "On-Demand Volumetric Feature Rendering through GPU Acceleration", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=JCehBDoAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=JCehBDoAAAAJ:rrpmhsargb8C", "authors": ["MOVANIA Muhammad Mobeen", "LIN Feng", "SEAH Hock Soon", "QIAN Kemao"], "description": "CT, MRI and confocal microscopy, generate a stack of high resolution images. Volume rendering has become a de facto standard technology in visualization of 3D structures implied in these image signals. Challenges to graphics researchers are mainly in supporting accurate assessment of the volumetric features such as surgical margin of cancerous tissues, through interactive, on-demand rendering of the desired features. We study the current volumetric rendering approaches on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and propose a novel approach to the on-demand feature rendering of the large volumetric datasets. We also present possible solutions to perspective volume rendering and provide an intuitive voxel tweaking scheme to allow interactive manipulation in real time on the GPU.
