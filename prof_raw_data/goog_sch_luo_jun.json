Given the inconvenience of contact sensing, both academia and industry have been intensively exploring contact-free vibration sensing, with several major developments leveraging radio-frequency (RF) technologies made very recently. However, a measurement study systematically comparing these options is still missing. In this paper, we choose to evaluate five representative commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RF technologies with different carrier frequencies, bandwidths, and waveform designs. We first unify the sensing data format and processing pipeline, and also propose a novel metric v-SNR to quantify sensing quality. Then our extensive evaluations start from controlled experiments for benchmarking, followed by investigations on two real-world applications: machinery vibration measurement and vital sign monitoring. Our comprehensive study reveals that Wi-Fi performs the worst among all five technologies, while a lesser-known UWB-based technology achieves the best overall performance, and others have respective pros and cons in different scenarios.", "total_citations": 1, "citation_graph": {"2023": 1}}, {"title": "Multi-band Reconfigurable Holographic Surface Based ISAC Systems: Design and Optimization", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=qXLjz30AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=qXLjz30AAAAJ:-6RzNnnwWf8C", "authors": ["Jingzhi Hu", "Zhe Chen", "Jun Luo"], "publication_date": "2023/3/28", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.15686", "description": "Metamaterial-based reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) have been proposed as novel cost-efficient antenna arrays, which are promising for improving the positioning and communication performance of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems.

However, we observe that this ineffectiveness is intrinsically connected to domain adaptability, another crucial issue in deep learning for which adversarial domain adaptation appears to be a promising solution. Consequently, we proposed Adv-4-Adv as a novel adversarial training method that aims to retain robustness against unseen adversarial perturbations. Essentially, Adv-4-Adv treats attacks incurring different perturbations as distinct domains, and by leveraging the power of adversarial domain adaptation, it aims to remove the domain/attack-specific features. This forces a trained model to learn a robust domain-invariant representation, which in turn enhances its generalization ability. Extensive evaluations on Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that a model trained by Adv-4-Adv based on samples crafted by simple attacks (e.g., FGSM) can be generalized to more advanced attacks (e.g., PGD), and the performance exceeds state-of-the-art proposals on these datasets.", "total_citations": 1, "citation_graph": {"2023": 1}}, {"title": "Variational Component Decoder for Source Extraction from Nonlinear Mixture", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=qXLjz30AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=qXLjz30AAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "authors": ["Shujie Zhang", "Tianyue Zheng", "Zhe Chen", "Jun Luo", "Sinno Pan"], "publication_date": "2021/10/6", "description": "In many practical scenarios of signal extraction from a nonlinear mixture, only one (signal) source is intended to be extracted.

In order to maintain the robustness in the face of real-life samples, sVCD combines Seq2Seq with variational inference to form a deep generative model, and it is trained by optimizing a variant of variational bound on the data likelihood concerning only the interested source.

It further transfers knowledge learned from labeled LoS domain to unlabeled occluded domain via adversarial learning, enabling OCHID-Fi to generalize to unseen occluded scenarios.
