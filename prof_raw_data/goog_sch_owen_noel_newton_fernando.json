As the initial step, we developed a control system, an actuator, which could digitally stimulate the sense of taste remotely. The system uses two approaches to stimulate taste sensations digitally: the electrical and thermal stimulations on tongue.

Our method uses natural feature matching algorithms and end-user programming approaches. The mnemonics can be concatenated into more complex command sequences. Thus, limited user input is realized by just taking photos with a camera embedded into a finger-ring, which enables rapid, subtle and socially acceptable user interaction. Our method can be used as semi-automatic way of achieving location and context sensitive services, activity recognition or tangible interaction."}, {"title": "Petimo: Children\u2019s Companion for Social Networking", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Rog8AvUAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=Rog8AvUAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "authors": ["Adrian David Cheok", "Owen Noel Newton Fernando", "Dilrukshi Abeyrathne", "Chamari Priyange Edirisinghe", "Nimesha Ranasinghe", "Kening Zhu", "Kasun Karunanayaka", "Roshan Lalintha Peiris", "Nancy Lan-Lan Ma"], "publication_date": "2011/3/10", "journal": "Journal of Japan Society of Kansei Engineering", "description": "Petimo is designed specifically for the use of children in the age group of 7-9yrs and special consideration was given to this factor when designing the physical properties. In Piaget [10] theory of cognitive development, children between the age of 7-12yrs are in the third stage of their cognitive development known as Concrete operations stage where they make the transition from the security and comfort of home to school and friends. Further, John Gottman states that to form successful friendships, children needed to find common-ground activities, communicate clearly, exchange information, resolve conflict and engage in sharing of personal information [5]. In addition, sociocultural theories determined that direct interaction children have with peers and adults have a profound influence in the child development and participating effectively in society [6, 7]. Therefore, Petimo is designed to enhance their experience of building social circles and networking both in the physical and digital world in a secure and healthy environment.\nAfter understanding the developmental stage our target user, the key factor taken into consideration during the design process of Petimo robot is the user-friendliness with an interactive interface and natural gestures. The purpose is to give them a tool that encourages them in making friends in both physical and virtual world. The Petimo allows them to move effortlessly between the physical and virtual interactive spaces. After surveying the market for existing toys like Tamagotchi and other handheld interactive toys, the observation was that these gadgets are all plastic encased-a hard surface with knobs.

However, despite its nimble and flexible nature, social media has been applied to health issues in silos. By this, we mean that social media affordances have either been applied to addressing specific aspects of a health issue, or have focused on addressing one issue at a time, such as infectious diseases. Given the apparent commonalities in the technological characteristics of social media for health interventions, applying the same features to a distinct set of health issues leads to reinventing the wheel and, more important, redundancy in technological deliverables. This paper addresses this issue by proposing the general architecture of Health Suite, an integrative common platform built on a plug-and-play model for health-related social media solutions. We present summary findings from formative research studies that informed our idea, offer a detailed description of Health Suite and its various modules, and demonstrate how Health Suite\u2019s modules have been adapted for designing a social media-based dengue prevention intervention in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The paper culminates with a brief discussion of challenges and future directions for this e-health architecture."}, {"title": "E-letter: a paper-based instant messaging system using selective wireless power transfer.", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Rog8AvUAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=Rog8AvUAAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC", "authors": ["Zhu Kening", "Hideaki Nii", "Owen Noel Newton Fernando"], "description": "Today as the rapid development of digital technology is turning our society into a paperless one, the traditional letter-writing has been replaced by digital media, such as EMail and Instant Messaging.

For paper-based letter communication, Gregory Davis [Davis 2009] mentioned that unlike electronic communication, the letter engages the totality of intellect, the heart, and the senses.\nConsidering the advantage of paper letter communication, in this paper we present E-Letter, a paper-based instant messaging system.

We have developed BlogWall to extend the SMS to a new level of self-expression and public communication by combining art and poetry. Furthermore, it will provide a means of expression in the language that children can understand, and the forms of social communication. BlogWall can also be used to educate the children while they interact and play with the system. The most notable feature of the system is its ability to mix up and generate poetry in multiple languages such as English, Korean, Chinese poems, or Japanese \u201cHaiku\u201d all based on the SMS.
