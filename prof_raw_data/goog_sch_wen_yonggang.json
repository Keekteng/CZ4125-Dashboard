With the trend of smart manufacturing and development of Internet of Things (IoT), data mining and Artificial Intelligence (AI), etc., PdM is proposed as a novel type of maintenance paradigm to perform maintenances only after the analytical models predict certain failures or degradations. In this survey, we first provide a high-level view of the PdM system architectures including the Open System Architecture for Condition Based Monitoring (OSA-CBM), cloud-enhanced PdM system and PdM 4.0, etc. Then, we make clear the specific maintenance purposes/objectives, which mainly comprise cost minimization, availability/reliability maximization and multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, we provide a review of the existing approaches for fault diagnosis and prognosis in PdM systems that include three major subcategories: knowledge based, traditional Machine Learning (ML) based and DL based approaches.

However, the increasing awareness of privacy protection limits sharing of decentralized unlabeled image data that grows explosively in multiple parties (eg mobile phones and cameras). As such, a natural problem is how to leverage these data to learn visual representations for downstream tasks while preserving data privacy. To address this problem, we propose a novel federated unsupervised learning framework, FedU. In this framework, each party trains models from unlabeled data independently using contrastive learning with an online network and a target network. Then, a central server aggregates trained models and updates clients' models with the aggregated global model. It preserves data privacy as each party only has access to its raw data. Decentralized data among multiple parties is normally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), which leads to performance degradation.

In this framework, a server coordinates multiple clients to conduct SSL training and periodically updates local models of clients with the aggregated global model. Using the framework, our study uncovers unique insights of FedSSL: 1) stop-gradient operation, previously reported to be essential, is not always necessary in FedSSL; 2) retaining local knowledge of clients in FedSSL is particularly beneficial for non-IID data.

Thus the cache hit ratio drops, and the bandwidth cost of serving the cache missed requests increases.

Specifically, we consider both the in-network caching and transcoding services at each ICN node, where the storage and transcoding resources can be dynamically scheduled.

To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first serverless system that takes full advantage of the client-fog-cloud synergy to better serve the DNN-based video analytics. Specifically, the system aims to achieve two goals: 1) Provide the optimal analytics results under the constraints of lower bandwidth usage and shorter round-trip time (RTT) by judiciously managing the computational and bandwidth resources deployed in the client, fog, and cloud environment. 2) Free developers from tedious administration and operation tasks, including DNN deployment, cloud and fog's resource management. To this end, we implement a holistic cloud-fog system referred to as VPaaS (Video-Platform-as-a-Service). VPaaS adopts serverless computing to enable developers to build a video analytics pipeline by simply programming a set of functions (e.g., model inference), which are then orchestrated to process videos through carefully designed modules. To save bandwidth and reduce RTT, VPaaS provides a new video streaming protocol that only sends low-quality video to the cloud. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNNs deployed at the cloud can identify regions of video frames that need further processing at the fog ends. At the fog ends, misidentified labels in these regions can be corrected using a light-weight DNN model.

INTRODUCTION ARTIFICIAL Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learn-ing (ML) approaches have emerged in the networking domain with great expectation.

As such, they meet the current interest in softwarization and network programmability that fuels the need for improved network automation in agile infrastructures, including edge and fog environments. Network design and optimization for AI/ML applications addresses the complementary topic of supporting AI/ML-based systems through novel networking techniques, including new architectures and algorithms. The third topic area is system implementation and open-source software development. This evolution draws particular attention to interdisciplinary approaches. Researchers in communication networks apply ML and AI concepts to optimize and automate network architecture, control, and management. Similarly, AI experts collaborate with networking researchers to optimize network support for architecture and design of data communication and processing for AI purposes.

Existing heterogeneous transfer learning (including multi-task learning) approaches handle multiple heterogeneous domains by usually learning feature transformations across different domains, but they ignore the high-order statistics (correlation information) which can only be discovered by simultaneously exploring all domains. We therefore develop a tensor based heterogeneous MTFL (THMTFL) framework to exploit such high-order information. Specifically, feature transformations of all domains are learned together, and finally used to derive new representations. A connection between all domains is built by using the transformations to project the pre-learned predictive structures of different domains into a common subspace, and minimizing their divergence in the subspace.

To address this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised federated face recognition approach (FedFR). FedFR improves the performance in the target domain by iteratively aggregating knowledge from the source domain through federated learning. It protects data privacy by transferring models instead of raw data between domains. Besides, we propose a new domain constraint loss (DCL) to regularize source domain training. DCL suppresses the data volume dominance of the source domain. We also enhance a hierarchical clustering algorithm to predict pseudo labels for the unlabeled target domain accurately. To this end, FedFR forms an end-to-end training pipeline: (1) pre-train in the source domain; (2) predict pseudo labels by clustering in the target domain; (3) conduct domain-constrained federated learning across two domains. Extensive experiments and analysis on two newly constructed benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of FedFR.

In this paper, we make the first attempt to understand the practicality of DP in FL through tuning the number of conducted iterations. Based on the FedAvg algorithm, we formally derive the convergence rate with DP noises in FL. Then, we theoretically derive: 1) the conditions for the DP based FedAvg to converge as the number of global iterations (GI) approaches infinity; 2) the method to set the number of local iterations (LI) to minimize the negative influence of DP noises. By further substituting the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms into the derived convergence rate respectively, we show that: 3) The DP based FedAvg with the Laplace mechanism cannot converge, but the divergence rate can be effectively prohibited by setting the number of LIs with our method; 4) The learning error of the DP based FedAvg with the Gaussian mechanism can converge to a constant number finally if we use a fixed number of LIs per GI. To verify our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments using two real-world datasets.

In particular, we learn an agent to predict the hashing codes sequentially under the DRL theme. Each coordinate of the hashing function can take the errors incurred by previous ones into consideration and hence more reliable hashing codes can be obtained than learning them independently. Besides, we design a novel level-specific reward function to gradually refine the hashing function according to the taxonomy information.

This replacement of electronic switching with optical switching at intermediate nodes, however, presents new challenges for fault detection and localization in reconfigurable all-optical networks. Presently, fault detection and localization techniques, as implemented in SONET/G.709 networks, rely on electronic processing of parity checks at intermediate nodes. If similar techniques are adapted to all-optical reconfigurable networks, optical signals need to be tapped out at intermediate nodes for parity checks. This additional electronic processing would break the all-optical transparency paradigm and thus significantly diminish the cost advantages of all-optical networks. In this thesis, we propose new fault-diagnosis approaches specifically tailored to all-optical networks, with an objective of keeping the diagnostic capital expenditure and the diagnostic operation effort low. Instead of the aforementioned passive monitoring paradigm based on parity checks, we propose a proactive lightpath probing paradigm: optical probing signals are sent along a set of lightpaths in the network, and network state (i.e., failure pattern) is then inferred from testing results of this set of end-to-end lightpath measurements.

In BAS, each road buffers the data packets with multiple duplicates propagation in order to provide more opportunities for packet switching at intersections. Different from conventional protocols in VANETs, the propagation of duplicates in BAS is bidirectional along the routing path. Moreover, BAS's cost is much lower than other flooding-based protocols due to its spatio-temporally controlled duplicates propagation. Different from recent researches, BAS can deliver packets not only to a stationary node, but also to the stationary or mobile nodes in a specified area. We conduct the extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of BAS based on the road map of a real city collected from Google Earth.

Recently, dividing WSOL into two parts (class-agnostic object localization and object classification) has become the state-of-the-art pipeline for this task. However, existing solutions under this pipeline usually suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) they are not flexible since they can only localize one object for each image due to the adopted single-class regression (SCR) for localization; 2) the generated pseudo bounding boxes may be noisy, but the negative impact of such noise is not well addressed. To remedy these drawbacks, we first propose to replace SCR with a binary-class detector (BCD) for localizing multiple objects, where the detector is trained by discriminating the foreground and background. Then we design a weighted entropy (WE) loss using the unlabeled data to reduce the negative impact of noisy bounding boxes.

We first formalize the problem of training simultaneous FL tasks. Then, we present our new approach, MAS (Merge and Split), to optimize the performance of training multiple simultaneous FL tasks. MAS starts by merging FL tasks into an all-in-one FL task with a multi-task architecture. After training for a few rounds, MAS splits the all-in-one FL task into two or more FL tasks by using the affinities among tasks measured during the all-in-one training.

We run experiments using Taskonomy dataset [6], which is a large and challenging computer vision (CV) dataset of indoor scenes of buildings. To facilitate reproducibility and mitigate computational requirements, we use the tiny split of Taskonomy dataset, 1 whose size is around 445GB. We select nine CV applications to form three sets of FL tasks: sdnkt, erckt, sdnkterca. These nine tasks are also used in [5]. Figure 1 provides sample images of these nine FL tasks. In particular, we employ indoor images of 32 buildings 2 as the total number of clients N= 32; each client contains images of a building to simulate the statistical heterogeneity. Figure 2 shows sample images of four clients; their indoor scenes vary in design, layout, objects, and illumination.\nImplementation Details.

In existing distributed hash table (DHT) based metadata management systems, the lookup service could be a performance bottleneck due to its significant CPU overhead. Our investigations showed that the lookup service could reduce system throughput by up to 70%, and increase system latency by a factor of up to 8 compared to ideal scenarios. In this paper, we present MetaFlow, a scalable metadata lookup service utilizing software-defined networking (SDN) techniques to distribute lookup workload over network components. MetaFlow tackles the lookup bottleneck problem by leveraging B-tree, which is constructed over the physical topology, to manage flow tables for SDN-enabled switches. Therefore, metadata requests can be forwarded to appropriate servers using only switches. Extensive performance evaluations in both simulations and testbed showed that MetaFlow increases system throughput by a factor of up to 3.2, and reduce system latency by a factor of up to 5 compared to DHT-based systems. We also deployed MetaFlow in a distributed file system, and demonstrated significant performance improvement."}, {"title": "Supplementary for Collaborative Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning from Decentralized Data", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=byeygOkAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=byeygOkAAAAJ:4Yq6kJLCcecC", "authors": ["Weiming Zhuang", "Xin Gan", "Yonggang Wen", "Shuai Zhang", "Shuai Yi"], "journal": "Threshold (\u00b5)", "description": "This supplementary material provides more implementation details and presents more experimental results, including ablation studies on DAPU, batch size, and the number of clients.

While several out-of-core graph processing systems and computation models have been proposed, the high disk I/O overhead could significantly reduce performance in many practical cases. In this paper, we propose GraphMP to tackle big graph analytics on a single machine. GraphMP achieves low disk I/O overhead with three techniques. First, we design a vertex-centric sliding window (VSW) computation model to avoid reading and writing vertices on disk. Second, we propose a selective scheduling method to skip loading and processing unnecessary edge shards on disk. Third, we use a compressed edge cache mechanism to fully utilize the available memory of a machine to reduce the amount of disk accesses for edges. Extensive evaluations have shown that GraphMP could outperform existing single-machine out-of-core systems such as GraphChi, X-Stream and GridGraph by up to 30, and can be as highly competitive as distributed graph engines like Pregel+, PowerGraph and Chaos."}, {"title": "Towards distributed machine learning in shared clusters: A dynamically-partitioned approach.(2017)", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=byeygOkAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=byeygOkAAAAJ:dAp6zn-oMfAC", "authors": ["Peng SUN", "Yonggang WEN", "Nguyen Binh Duong TA", "Shengen YAN"], "journal": "Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP), May", "description": "Many cluster management systems (CMSs) have been proposed to share a single cluster with multiple distributed computing systems.

Specifically, Dorm uses the container-based virtualization technique to partition a cluster, runs one application per partition, and can dynamically resize each partition at application runtime for resource efficiency and fairness. Each application directly launches its tasks on the assigned partition without petitioning for resources frequently, so Dorm imposes flat sharing overhead.
