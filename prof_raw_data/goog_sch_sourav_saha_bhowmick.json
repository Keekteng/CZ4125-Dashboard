This paper focuses on HNE for massive graphs, e.g., with billions of edges. On this scale, most existing approaches fail, as they incur either prohibitively high costs, or severely compromised result utility. Our proposed solution, called Node-Reweighted PageRank (NRP), is based on a classic idea of deriving embedding vectors from pairwise personalized PageRank (PPR) values. Our contributions are twofold: first, we design a simple and efficient baseline HNE method based on PPR that is capable of handling billion-edge graphs on commodity hardware; second and more importantly, we identify an inherent drawback of vanilla PPR, and address it in our main proposal NRP. Specifically, PPR was designed for a very different purpose, i.e., ranking nodes in G based on their relative importance from a source node's perspective. In contrast, HNE aims to build node embeddings considering the whole graph. Consequently, node embeddings derived directly from PPR are of suboptimal utility. The proposed NRP approach overcomes the above deficiency through an effective and efficient node reweighting algorithm, which augments PPR values with node degree information, and iteratively adjusts embedding vectors accordingly. Overall, NRP takes O(mlogn) time and O(m) space to compute all node embeddings for a graph with m edges and n nodes. Our extensive experiments that compare NRP against 18 existing solutions over 7 real graphs demonstrate that NRP achieves \u2026", "total_citations": 54, "citation_graph": {"2020": 4, "2021": 13, "2022": 10, "2023": 27}}, {"title": "Omnia mutantur, nihil interit: Connecting past with present by finding corresponding terms across time", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=o0F3sqEAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=o0F3sqEAAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC", "authors": ["Yating Zhang", "Adam Jatowt", "Sourav Bhowmick", "Katsumi Tanaka"], "publication_date": "2015/7", "conference": "Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers)", "description": "In the current fast-paced world, people tend to possess limited knowledge about things from the past.

We identify and analyze an array of features that may affect a blogger's cascade joining behavior and utilize these features to predict cascade affinity of blogs. Evaluated on a real dataset consisting of 873,496 posts, our svm-based prediction achieved accuracy of 0.723 measured by F1. Our experiments also showed that among all features identified, the number of friends was the most important factor affecting bloggers' inclination to join \u2026", "total_citations": 19, "citation_graph": {"2010": 2, "2011": 7, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}, {"title": "XML data integration based on content and structure similarity using keys", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=o0F3sqEAAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=o0F3sqEAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "authors": ["Waraporn Viyanon", "Sanjay K Madria", "Sourav S Bhowmick"], "publication_date": "2008", "conference": "On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems: OTM 2008: OTM 2008 Confederated International Conferences, CoopIS, DOA, GADA, IS, and ODBASE 2008, Monterrey, Mexico, November 9-14, 2008, Proceedings, Part I", "description": "This paper proposes a technique for approximately matching XML data based on the content and structure by detecting the similarity of subtrees clustered semantically using leaf-node parents.

The tag/collection language models are derived from the bag of visual-word local content features of the images. The visual-representative tags that are commonly used to annotate visually similar images are given high tag clarity scores.

Unfortunately, this classical IM problem ignores the fact that time taken for influence propagation to reach the largest scope can be significant in realworld social networks, during which the underlying network itself may have evolved. This phenomenon may have considerable adverse impact on the quality of selected seeds and as a result all existing techniques that use this classical definition as their building block generate seeds with suboptimal influence spread. In this paper, we revisit the classical IM problem and propose a more realistic version called PROTEUS-IM (Propagation Time conscious Influence Maximization) to replace it by addressing the aforementioned limitation. Specifically, as influence propagation may take time, we assume that the underlying social network may evolve during influence propagation. Consequently, PROTEUSIM aims to select seeds in the current network to maximize influence spread in the future instance of the network at the end of influence propagation process without assuming complete topological knowledge of the future network.

However, in this scenario, there exist serious security and privacy issues that sensitive information contained in the dataset can be leaked. The most effective way to address that is to encrypt the data before outsourcing. Nevertheless, it remains a grand challenge to process queries in ciphertext efficiently. In this work, we shall focus on solving one representative query task, namely dynamic skyline query, in a secure manner over the cloud. However, it is difficult to be performed on encrypted data as its dynamic domination criteria require both subtraction and comparison, which cannot be directly supported by a single encryption scheme efficiently. To this end, we present a novel framework called SCALE. It works by transforming traditional dynamic skyline domination into pure comparisons. The whole process can be completed in single-round interaction between user and the cloud. We theoretically prove that the outsourced database, query requests, and returned results are all kept secret under our model. Moreover, we also present an efficient strategy for dynamic insertion and deletion of stored records.

On the one hand, there has been a host of work, cf,[4, 8], on enabling relational databases to be tree-aware by invading the database kernel to support xml. On the other hand, some completely jettison the invasive approach and resort to a tree-unaware approach, cf,[3, 7, 9, 14, 15, 17], where the database kernel is not modified to support xml queries. The tree-unaware approach reuses existing code, has a lower cost of implementation, and is more portable since it can be implemented on top of off-the-shelf rdbmss. However, due to the lack of statistics of tree structures in underlying relational storage schemes, the relational optimizer may generate inefficient query plans. This is consistent with recent results [4, 8] that tree-aware approaches appear to be more scalable and, in particular, perform orders of magnitude faster than several tree-unaware approaches such as [15, 17].\nWhile the tree-aware approaches are certainly attractive, they are in general incompatible with relational databases. The rdbmss need to augment their suite of query processing strategies by incorporating special purpose external index systems, algorithms and storage schemes to perform efficient xml query processing.

Specifically, we explore two variants of the problem, namely batch TIPS and incremental TIPS, to cater to diverse set of learners.

Since the last decade, a number of graph query languages (eg, SPARQL, Cypher) have been proposed to facilitate textual formulation of subgraph queries. All these languages assume that a user has programming and debugging expertise to formulate queries correctly in these languages. Unfortunately, this assumption makes it harder for nonprogrammers to take advantage of a subgraph search framework as it requires significant time and effort to learn these languages. For example, domain experts such as chemists cannot be expected to learn the complex syntax of a graph query language in order to formulate meaningful queries over a chemical compound database such as PubChem (http://pubchem. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/) or eMolecule (https://www. emolecules. com/).

The update filter aims to efficiently reject untranslatable view updates by estimating the side effects of the updates, thereby avoiding costly translation analysis. For applications where estimation errors are not preferred, our update filter can be tuned to be exact. In this paper, we present our approach with SPJ views, an important class of view definitions.

The shapelets are convenient for interpreting the clusters. Thus, the main challenge for TSC is to discover high-quality variable-length shapelets to discriminate different clusters. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder-shapelet approach (AUTOSHAPE), which is the first study to take the advantage of both autoencoder and shapelet for determining shapelets in an unsupervised manner. An autoencoder is specially designed to learn high-quality shapelets. More specifically, for guiding the latent representation learning, we employ the latest self-supervised loss to learn the unified embeddings for variable-length shapelet candidates (time series subsequences) of different variables, and propose the diversity loss to select the discriminating embeddings in the unified space. We introduce the reconstruction loss to recover shapelets in the original time series space for clustering. Finally, we adopt Davies Bouldin index (DBI) to inform AUTOSHAPE of the clustering performance during learning. We present extensive experiments on AUTOSHAPE. To evaluate the clustering performance on univariate time series (UTS), we compare AUTOSHAPE with 15 representative methods using UCR archive datasets. To study the performance of multivariate time series (MTS), we evaluate AUTOSHAPE on 30 UEA archive datasets with 5 competitive methods. The results validate that AUTOSHAPE is the best among all the methods compared.

In this paper, we propose a novel and non-traditional technique for fast evaluation of multi-source star twig queries in a path materialization-based RDBMS. A multi-source star twig joins different XML documents on values in their nodes and the XQuery graph takes a star-shaped structure. Such queries are prevalent in several domains such as life sciences. Rather than following the conventional approach of generating one huge complex SQL query from a twig query, we translate a star query into a list of SQL sub-queries that only materializes minimal information of underlying XML subtrees as intermediate results. We have implemented this scheme on top of a path materialization-based XML storage system called SUCXENT++.

In this demonstration, we present a novel data-driven and generic system called FUSE (Functional Summary Generator) that generates functional maps of a PPI at different levels of organization, from broad process-process level interactions to in-depth complex-complex level interactions. By simultaneously evaluating interaction and annotation data, FUSE abstracts higher-order interaction maps by reducing the details of the underlying PPI to form a functional summary graph of interconnected functional clusters.

We proposed a set of algorithms to extract frequent cqp s (fcqps) and infrequent cqp s (icqps) and rank these query paths using evolution-conscious ranking functions.

Informally, nca-twiglet is a subtree in a twig pattern where all nodes have the same nearest common ancestor (the root of nca-twiglet). We focus on nca-twiglets having parent-child relationships. Our scheme is build on top of our Sucxent++ system. We show that by exploiting the encoding scheme of Sucxent++ we can reduce useless structural comparisons in order to evaluate nca-twiglets.

In our approach we transform the unordered hidden web query results to XML format and then detect the changes between two versions of XML representation of the hidden web data by extending X-Diff, a published unordered XML change detection algorithm. By taking advantage of the semantics, we experimentally demonstrate that our change detection approach runs up to 7 times faster than X-Diff on real life hidden web data and always detect changes that are semantically more correct than those detected by existing proposals."}, {"title": "Mining Historical XML", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=o0F3sqEAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=o0F3sqEAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "authors": ["Qiankun Zhao", "Sourav Saha Bhowmick"], "publication_date": "2005", "book": "Encyclopedia of Data Warehousing and Mining", "description": "Nowadays the Web poses itself as the largest data repository ever available in the history of humankind (Reis et al., 2004).
