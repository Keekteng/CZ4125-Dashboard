Prior to joining NTU, she was a Postdoc (under the International Postdoctoral Fellowship) at the Allen School's NLP group from University of Washington, working with Noah Smith and Hanna Hajishirzi. Before that, she has been awarded the \"Lee Kuan Yew Postdoctoral Fellowship\" in 2019. She received her PhD degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, NTU, supervised by Sinno Jialin Pan, and the BSc degree from the School of Mathematical Sciences, NTU. She also worked as a Machine Learning Research Associate in SAP Research and Innovation. Her research interests lie in reasoning for Natural Language Processing (or multimodal learning), including symbolic (logic) reasoning, commonsense reasoning, knowledge integration, and robustness or
