He received his Bachelor and Master degrees in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University, Master and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Stony Brook University. His research interests fall into the general areas of visual computing and he is particularly interested in the problems which require geometric analysis and computation. He is an Associate Editor of Journal of Computational Visual Media (Springer) and Computer Graphics Forum (Wiley). He regularly serves on the Technical Program Committee for major research conferences in geometric modeling and computer graphics.", "grants": ["A 4D Variational Framework for Constructing 3D Self-Supporting Surfaces", "Holistic Moving Target Defence for Autonomous Driving Perception", "Iterative Poisson Surface Reconstruction: A Novel Computational Tool for Constructing Large-scale, Complex 3D Scenes in Metaverse", "Reconstruct 3D Surfaces of Arbitrary Topology Using Unsigned Distance Fields", "Small Dataset Training, Efficient Geodesic Representation"], "keywords": ["Computer Science and Engineering"], "goog_sch_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ISNmBxwAAAAJ", "interests": ["Geometric modeling", "computer graphics", "3D deep learning"], "citation_table": {"columns": ["All", "Since 2018"], "Citations": [5304, 2502], "h-index": [41, 27], "i10-index": [126, 73]}, "citation_graph": {"2006": 60, "2007": 53, "2008": 94, "2009": 112, "2010": 140, "2011": 176, "2012": 250, "2013": 270, "2014": 352, "2015": 444, "2016": 378, "2017": 370, "2018": 379, "2019": 383, "2020": 400, "2021": 388, "2022": 484, "2023": 462, "2005": 21, "2004": 5, "2002": 0, "2003": 0}, "education": {"Bachelor Degree": "Tsinghua University", "Master Degree": "Stony Brook University", "PhD": "Stony Brook University"}, "pub_graph": {"2007": 4, "2005": 5, "2016": 14, "2002": 1, "2011": 20, "2009": 5, "2010": 10, "2017": 7, "2013": 13, "2020": 14, "2014": 15, "2004": 2, "2015": 8, "2008": 2, "2006": 3, "2012": 17, "2019": 13, "2021": 8, "2018": 14, "2023": 14, "2022": 6, "2003": 0}, "h_index_graph": {"2007": 7, "2008": 11, "2009": 12, "2010": 14, "2011": 17, "2012": 17, "2013": 20, "2014": 24, "2015": 26, "2016": 28, "2017": 29, "2018": 30, "2019": 33, "2020": 34, "2021": 35, "2022": 39, "2023": 41, "2005": 4, "2006": 6, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1}, "avg_citation_graph": {"2002": 0.0, "2003": 0.0, "2004": 1.6666666666666667, "2005": 3.25, "2006": 7.818181818181818, "2007": 9.266666666666667, "2008": 13.705882352941176, "2009": 15.681818181818182, "2010": 15.15625, "2011": 12.711538461538462, "2012": 13.202898550724637, "2013": 14.402439024390244, "2014": 15.804123711340207, "2015": 18.82857142857143, "2016": 19.789915966386555, "2017": 21.626984126984127, "2018": 22.17142857142857, "2019": 22.790849673202615, "2020": 23.275449101796408, "2021": 24.428571428571427, "2022": 26.29281767955801, "2023": 26.774358974358975}}
