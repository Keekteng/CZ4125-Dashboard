Before joining NTU, he was an Assistant Professor in Aalborg University, Denmark. Before that, he worked as a researcher at Microsoft Research Asia. From 2004 to 2006, he worked as a postdoc in University of Edinburgh. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from National University of Singapore in 2004. His general research interests are in Data Science. In particular, his research focuses on geospatial data management, spatio-temporal data mining, recommendation, and mining social media data. He has published in prestigious journals (e.g., VLDB Journal, TODS, TKDE) and conferences (e.g., VLDB, SIGMOD, ICDE, KDD, WSDM, SIGIR, WWW). His citation in Google Scholar was over 14000 with H-index 61. He served as a PC co-chair for ICDE\u20192022, an associate chair of KDD\u201921, a PC co-chair for E&A track of VLDB 2014, and a PC vice-Chair for ICDE\u201918. He is an associate editor for ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS) and the vice Chair of ACM KDD Singapore chapter.", "grants": ["Build a question answer knowledge base for health care workers and patients", "Collaborative AI \u201cSpatio-temporal Network Learning for Smart Cities, Knowledge Representation with Graph Neural Networks\u201d", "Data Driven Human Preference Analytics For Urban Computing", "Deep Trajectory Representation meets Big Trajectory Querying and Mining", "Machine Learning Driven Query Optimizers for Big Database Systems", "Novel context-aware multivariate time series modelling for underground transportation infrastructure monitoring and management", "Preserving Individual Privacy In Urban Informatics", "Refining Seismic Hazard Estimation for Singapore through Deep-Learning Aided Earthquake Detection", "Singtel-NTU Cognitive & Artificial Intelligence Joint Lab (Overhead)", "Singtel-NTU Congnitive & Artifical Intelligence Joint Lab, Common Activities Account", "Towards Semantic-Aware Multimodal and Multilingual Deep Learning Systems for E-Commerce Applications", "TradeMaster: Reinforcement Learning-based Quantitative Trading Toolkit", "TradeMaster: Reinforcement Learning-based Quantitative Trading Toolkit (SMU)"], "keywords": ["Artificial and Augmented Intelligence", "Computer Science and Engineering", "Smart Cities", "Sociology"], "goog_sch_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WFFamJkAAAAJ", "interests": ["Data Management", "Databases", "Data Mining", "Spatial Databases"], "citation_table": {"columns": ["All", "Since 2018"], "Citations": [17777, 10314], "h-index": [69, 53], "i10-index": [165, 141]}, "citation_graph": {"2013": 600, "2014": 846, "2015": 1228, "2016": 1385, "2017": 1560, "2018": 1629, "2019": 1680, "2020": 1873, "2021": 1779, "2022": 1736, "2023": 1603, "2010": 225, "2011": 293, "2012": 474, "2009": 186, "2008": 136, "2002": 7, "2003": 6, "2004": 40, "2005": 53, "2006": 93, "2007": 98}, "education": {"Bachelor Degree": null, "Master Degree": null, "PhD": "National University of Singapore"}, "pub_graph": {"2013": 10, "2009": 5, "2010": 11, "2015": 16, "2007": 6, "2011": 7, "2020": 16, "2008": 5, "2003": 1, "2014": 13, "2017": 12, "2012": 24, "2018": 18, "2004": 9, "2021": 15, "2005": 2, "2016": 16, "2019": 10, "2006": 7, "2002": 3, "2023": 12, "2022": 13, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0}, "h_index_graph": {"2013": 25, "2014": 29, "2015": 35, "2016": 38, "2017": 43, "2018": 49, "2019": 53, "2020": 56, "2021": 60, "2022": 64, "2023": 68, "2009": 13, "2010": 16, "2011": 18, "2012": 23, "2007": 8, "2008": 10, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2002": 1}, "avg_citation_graph": {"1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 2.3333333333333335, "2003": 3.25, "2004": 4.076923076923077, "2005": 7.066666666666666, "2006": 9.045454545454545, "2007": 10.607142857142858, "2008": 13.121212121212121, "2009": 16.289473684210527, "2010": 17.224489795918366, "2011": 20.303571428571427, "2012": 20.1375, "2013": 24.566666666666666, "2014": 29.679611650485437, "2015": 36.00840336134454, "2016": 42.0, "2017": 49.183673469387756, "2018": 53.69090909090909, "2019": 60.222857142857144, "2020": 64.98429319371728, "2021": 68.8883495145631, "2022": 72.72602739726027}}
